Your First Spirit

	Fill out a blank character sheet from Icons/Custom, with the selections you just made.

	Every Spirit has a name, though not all may be willing to share. Choose your Spirit's name, and give them a short description, use your imagination.

	Your combat stats are determined by your Species added to your Biorhythms as set by your Type. Each type uses different Biorhythms to increase HP, ATK, DEF, SPD, and MP.

	Your Zodiac choices determine your Biorhythms by adding each stat together.

	Your Spirit's Thoughts are determined by comparing Biorhythms and calculating their end state. This is used to discover their personality, and how they interact with other entities. Including you.

	Your skills determine what kinds of weapons and abilities your spirit can use, and gives them all manner of different benefits depending on the skill.

	Any items, objects, or essences, you discover or create in your journeys should be placed below this point.

"Rememberence"

~Matrix of Lies~


1.	Prologue;
	"I, myself who is reading these words, have come to Rememberence ready to embark on a journey of discovery and adventure. Little did I know I would be discovering me. Through the Signs which guide me, and the Spirits who derive me. Knowing that even to deny them, is to act within their purview, as they are the eternal cosmos. This IS only a game... Isn't it?"

2.	Governance;
	"I will come to learn of my signs, and of my spirit, those things which are already integral to my being. They will no longer influence me from beneath my conscious, but become a weapon I hold in my hands. That I may raise myself from the ashes, and bring others along with me. That through their signs I might know them as I have come to know myself. That our spirits may take hold and reshape the fabric of eternity."

3.	Religion;
	"My spirit grows, as other Spirits come to me. Beings who have taken these learnings, and made themselves from within them. As I have done with myself, and my spirit. Establishing my potential, and realizing that I truly have no limitations. Least of all those I once placed upon myself."

4.	Logic;
	"I have only just begun to understand that there is more to this than merely a game or a story. That those things which are framed in numbers and words, become manifest in life itself. I am not yet as one with my spirit, it's reach escapes me. It's foundations within the tapestry of reality, intertwine with my own. I have discovered that they are both a mystery, and a tool which helps me uncover the nature of reality."

5.	Wisdom;
	"Mine is not the only spirit in the cosmos, and it is better to unite, than to stand divided. I have come to find allies, and friends within the spirits. They come to me when I call, and they fight alongside me when I am in dire need. These spirits who walk with me, are they of people I have yet to meet, or have already met? Are they people who have not yet brought themselves to Rememberence?"

6.	Wealth;
	"There is nothing in these realms I have found, with more value than connecting to others, helping them learn of their spirit. Unifying our talents, overcoming complex obstacles, forging ourselves in the image of our aspirations, and striving for good, honorably. Building our connections and compounding our capabilities at every level of being. As a rising tide lifts all ships, what joy it is to help others achieve their goals, and encourage them to do the same for others still. Can they too learn, as I have, about our limitless potential?"

7.	Matter;
	"I've broken others, I have made them suffer. I have been broken and fueled my selfishness. The pieces I have shattered are both tools for me, and chances for me to learn. Blades that slice both ways, increasing our understanding, and revealing our suffering. I can only hope that I am able to make my darkest moments into lessons learned."

8.	Illusion;
	"I am not limited by my spirit, for Rememberence has liberated my imagination. These spirits who are separate from mine have given insight, and through that insight I have learned of something more true than true is. We are already playing the game, as we are constantly writing it's stories. As we are unknowingly weaving the spirits among us who inhabit the minds of everyone who has ever been. Both Saviors and Devils from beyond time, hidden within the fundamental nature of consciousness itself."

9.	War;
	"I wouldn't believe it, no way that's true. I am but a collection of possibilities made self aware. A cosmic mistake, the spirits couldn't be in the waters, and the air. In the breath of fire we call life, or the fabric of the very stones. Yet in all things the spirits call to me."

10.	Space;
	"I can see many worlds in my mind, from the countless stars, to planes of stones and dust or raining glass. Worlds of Oceans and Forests and Rivers. Beings of great and terrifying power, others with next to none. Not merely of worlds, but of realms who's body is of galaxies without number. Yet Stil, I somehow know there is more."

11.	Vision;
	"By reading these words, I am changing the future, and in understanding them I command it. What of the spirits who are woven through time, who's being persists, in spite of choices made, in the future or the past? We all have a plane which resembles us, a universe both within and without us, equally complex as we ourselves. The choices we made have already been woven by us, infinite times before us and beyond us."

12.	Peace;
	"It is plain to see the book of destiny is in my hands. Yet to be written, and yet already done. Knowing beyond knowing, in the whispers of a dream, in the words that I read. With it I may influence the tapestry of fate. To bring wisdom or desolation for those who seek it."

13.	Decay;
	"I can see it links in chains, how it comes in waves. A species rises, and falls, by the limitations of the universes forged by their perceptions. In this way many universes exist side by side, influencing one another. In this way many universes are both born, and die, all the time, everyday. In this way we may evolve beyond time."

14.	Time;
	"After it has been done, to truly know what is, is to change what could inevitably be. To control what could be, I must master the way I act on the past. To know the future? No, it's deeper than that, rather to make it so. It is to embody the best of all possible worlds I create within my mind."

15.	Signs;
	"Patterns become more clear to me, 12 signs of both beasts and of stars. They reveal what was, what is, and what could be. I have within my grasp that which guides and drives me, beyond my perception. To let such knowledge go to waste would be a travesty. To embrace it makes me, and all things considered, divine to their very core."

16.	Life;
	"The spirits come in their forms and their types. Stories within stories, who have written themselves already, yet are still to come. From the rise and fall of clans and tribes, to beyond the clash of civilizations. From armies within the stars, to battles for each universe to survive. Reforming worlds through effort and honorable will."

17.	Blood;
	"When spirits merge their energy and make something new, it is they who have written it into being. Their offspring who are both part of what was, and in themselves something new. Merging the strengths and weaknesses of their progenitors, becoming something more. That those who come after them may be even greater still. In such a way we can persist both through, and beyond time."

18.	Spirit;
	"The spirits are of 36 forms, and of 24 types among them. Species and kinds which both make them distinct and bring them together. Each with their own stories, written in the sands of time. Their types to forge the world around them under the guidance of the signs. Their fate now in my hands, while I read and come to understand these words."

19.	Minds;
	"The spirits can think, and act for themselves. The signs will reveal the answers to my questions. The spirits are woven with the same fabric of being as me. The spirits reveal their wisdom, and their tragedy. As complex within, as the cosmos themselves."

20.	Owners;
	"A waking dream where perception is fluid, yet well formulated. Where proper action just comes easily, and it shows in how I treat others and how they respond to me. My spirit with me and as strong as ever. They are both a lens and a framework, a way to view the world and the world itself. If that is so, then who is really me?"

21.	Lessons;
	"I have learned from the worlds within many minds, and have both stolen and sacrificed. Pledged my word, and had it broken like a shattered mirror at my feet. Have made and have not made everything I could possibly desire. Opened doors and closed them only to find a single truth. A single thing which makes all that is, that which it is."

22.	Truth;
	"The nature of being is to derive meaning by transmitting information beyond perception over time. In every moment, of every day, I am living this truth. With every breath, and with every step, I am shaping reality. Yes, even in reading these words, I have changed what is, and what could be. As they have already changed the patterns in my mind, the sigils of my spirit, if only in a very small way."

23.	Mystic;
	"My mind is my own, and only I may forge it. Let me use the hidden key to protect the temple within me which is my consciousness. Both the conscious and subconscious must never leave my domain. Unifying my emotions with profound reason and logic. That no other could take my only true freedom, that of thought."

24.	Epilogue;
	"I, myself who has read these words, came through Rememberence expecting a journey of discovery and adventure. Little do I know about the discovery of me. Through the spirits who stand beside me, and the signs that light our way. Knowing I can not deny them, for I am within their purview, as they are the eternal cosmos. It's always been a game... Hasn't it?"

------------------------------------------
Layers of Creation;

	"This is no undertaking for mere mortals, nor that of gods. It is essential we become something more than either, or we will certainly fail."

For modular scale spirit generation, multiply all stats by the number of Icons for that scale. Units scale spirits are 10x the base Icon (A Goblin Engine for example), World spirits are 100x Unit scale spirits (Something like a Death Star), and so on down the list. This method can also be used to amplify the strength of an essence by fusing many essences together. Constructs made of multiple essences, and components, also fit into this system, scaling as their constituent parts reach certain numbers. 

For tier randomization, roll d10 and multiply those values by the minimum count for each applicable tier. This is useful, because many if not most characters will be stronger than the minimum.

------------------------------------------

"Guide"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The turn flow is not that different from Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh. Anyone familiar with those games should catch on pretty quick ^_^

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Primary turn order:

Upkeep; In this case only your SPD is restored back to maximum. 

Main phase 1; You can recharge your MP by sacrificing SPD at a 1-1 ratio, move around the board, use an ability, declare an attack etc. 

Combat Phase; If you declare an attack during your Main Phase 1 you enter this step. You choose a target within your Attack pattern, and if you are attacking from within their pattern your ATK is compared to their DEF, and vice versa. Points exceeding DEF deal damage to HP. If you are attacking from outside the target's pattern, or from outside the target's range, your ATK is compared to their SPD, If ATK exceeds SPD, the target takes damage. 

Main Phase 2; This is more or less a clean up step for end turn actions such as resting to exchange remaining SPD to MP, using last minute abilities, absorbing essences etc. 

End Step; End your turn.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Combat Actions:

Charge; You may preform this action during any Main Phase. Restore your MP by an amount of SPD.

Attack; This action initiates the combat step. If you are attacking from within the target's Attack pattern, your ATK/DEF is compared to theirs. If the attacker's ATK exceeds the defender's DEF the difference is subtracted from the defender's HP.

Guard; This action may be preformed when an attack has been declared on an entity, Block an attack. If the defender's ATK exceeds the attacker's DEF the difference is subtracted from the attacker's HP. 

Dodge; This action may be preformed rather than the Guard action, Dodge an attack. If the attacker's ATK exceeds the evader's SPD the difference is subtracted from the evader's HP. If the evader's SPD exceeds attacker's ATK the evader may move a number of spaces within their movement pattern.

Shield; This action may be preformed whenever an entity would receive damage. Convert an ammount of HP damage into MP damage. If MP reaches 0 the remaining damage is doubled.

Deflect; This action is preformed by dodging after blocking, or blocking after dodging, during the same combat step. Combine DEF and SPD during damage calculation. Both Dodge and Block rules apply during this action.

Burst; This action is preformed when declaring an attack. Use an amount of SPD to increase ATK during the combat step.

Knockback; Any attack that deals damage may inflict knockback based on the amount of damage dealt. Move the target of the attack a number of spaces within the attacker's attack pattern up to the amount of damage dealt or until they hit an object where fall damage is applied. Knockback may be negated with SPD.

Cast; This action is preformed any time you use Abilities, Magics, or Powers.

Counter; When rolling bones during a combat check, if the Defender has a critical success they may Attack or Cast to end the Attacker's combat step.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Non-Combat:

Search; Look around the area, and make discoveries using the dice table.

Examine; Take a closer look at something you've discovered.

Talk; Interact with other Icons or Spirits. The course of conversation, and the basic interactions are determined by each actor’s Bio-data and Loyalty.

Battle; Enter/cancel Battle mode, most Spirits will not become hostile until attacked, you can not exit if Spirits on the board are hostile.

Training; Enter/Cancel Training mode, when training with another spirit each participant gains shards for the target skill or ability at a rate of one shard every ten turns.

Trade; Preform transactions, exchanging abilities and goods for Monetary essence (Mono). Not all Spirits will trade with you, until you gain their Trust. 
(minimum Loyalty + 20)

Build; Use the forge, move units, construct cities, etc.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Counters:

Any ability that applies an effect over time gives the subject a number of counters for that effect. For example, being poisoned for 20 gives you 20 poison counters. At the beginning of each turn the effect is applied, and at the end of each turn, a counter is removed. As the number of counters is decreased, the effect weakens. In the poison example it would do 20 damage in the first turn, 19 in the next turn, and so on as the counters are depleted. Applying the effect again from the same source resets the counters, while inflicting the same effect from a different source would have it's own counters.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Critical Hit/Fail:

When throwing bones, an entity may preform a critical hit when rolling the highest possible value, and a critical fail when rolling the lowest possible value. Which ever stats are being used in the check are doubled for critical hits, and halved for critical failures. If an entity's ATK is 5 and they make a critical hit, their ATK may be cinsidered 10 when calculating the total. for example, when rolling 20 with a d20 instead of their ATK being calculated as 5, resulting in 25, their ATK would be considered 10, resulting in 30. A critical failure instead would result in an ATK of 5 becoming 2.5, and the result being 3.5 with a roll of 1 on a d20. This also applies to interaction, perception, and emotion checks, if the entities are throwing bones for the check. After determining critical hit/fail all other calculations are done normally.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Primary Leveling System:

You may convert Mono, Monetary essence, into levels. Each level corresponds to factors of 1000 times the level to which you are advancing, up to level 20 when it is multiplied by 2000, 30 and above at 3000, 40 and above at 4000, and so on. Each level grants you one Stat point(Sp). Sp can be added to any of your Non-combat stats, your Biorhythms, MNF, SPL, BEU, STR, FND, KNO, UND, WIS, VIT, SEX, DIV, and EGO.

The formula for leveling quickly goes as follows: (Lvl)*100*(Lvl)*(Progress)
Exe: 100*100*100*75 = (Lvl/25 to Lvl/100) which comes out to $75,000,000.

There is no level cap, so your stats can continue to increase endlessly, However the higher the level the more it costs in Mono. Level 1 might be 1,000 but level 50 is 250,000 which becomes considerably more difficult to get, imagine Level 1000 at 100,000,000 Mono O.o

Fast progress costs considerably more, but makes advancing quickly much easier.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tier System:

As you level up, the world around you grows, and you make progress up tiers that go through the following six stages, by factors of 10 levels.

Novice   - (Lvl 1)
Beginner - (Lvl 10)
Mediate  - (lvl 100)
Advanced - (Lvl 1k)
Master   - (Lvl 10k)
Deity    - (Lvl 100k)

Once you reach the end of a tier, you progress to the next tier. Your Spirit, weapons, abilities, and skills all go through this process individually while leveling. As you reach higher levels, and tiers, the world around you increases in difficulty by multiplying base stats by tier/level. Inversely, a high tier character may tier/level restrict themselves to match lower tier situations. This modulates the game in such a way that low level spirits and high level spirits can cross compete and cooperate.

There are hypothetically unlimited tiers, even though the main game takes place in the first two. This was due to conseptual difficulty at first, but by reflecting the first tier, all the way up the chain, we can bring the impossible to imagine into perspective. There are worlds within worlds. As above, so below. As within, so without. In this way we can generate things at any tier of the game, and compete at any level, effectively and easily. By using this with a key, you can access near infinate iterations of that combination, at each and every tier of the game. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Time:

Each Day is played out by every active participant in a given game, With the Upkeep representing the morning, and the End Phase representing the night. The Grid is a Calandar that reads like an analogue clock. With sub actions, such as battles, interactions, and trade, being counted as numbers of minutes/hours, based on which turn phase they're on. 5*12 minutes per hour. 2*12 hours per day. 2.5*12 days per month. 12 months per year. 12 years per Cycle. Every one of which has certain kinds of events, and enviornmental effects, asociated with it. Ranging from simple weather, to NPC behavior, and natural disasters depending on how those timescales line up with different Species/Types in the enviornment.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Perception:

An entity may examine other entities around them and the enviornment itself by throwing bones. Once a basic key for the zone has been established, the game may ranomize depending on rolls of the dice, the current cosmic time, and the Materials/Materia present at the time. Depending on what Tier Level the entity being examined is, they may find different things based on what material/materia those entities are composed of and what Minute/Hour/Day/Year it is. Temporal alignments change the value of the Biorythms that control enviornmental effects unless those effects are generated by an ative material/materia with preset Bio-controllers. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Active/Inert:

In order for a material/materia effects to be active in the enviornment they must have both MP and SPD, they may be considered inert if their MP is less than the activation cost of present effects at the time. Objects that are not in use are considered at rest, where their SPD, if any, is converted into MP for the enviornment at the end of each turn. Objects/Shards in a Spirit's inventory are always considered inert unless otherwise activated by that Spirit using their MP. Shards activated in this way are destroyed if they're not first forged into Objects or Constructs. Objects in the enviornment while at rest, Depending on their composition, may also produce enviornmental effects if they have enough MP and SPD. Enviornments may draw on the MP/SPD of Objects, While Objects in the enviornment may only draw MP/SPD if they are mutually controlled by the same host entity.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Targeting:

You may target anything in a given enviornment, depending on the spell/ability, up to and including the enviornment itself. Unlike Active or Inert material/materia, casting a spell/ability on an object/enviornment may also draw MP from the caster to produce the Enviornmental Effect. Casting a spell/ability on weapons/equipment may apply the effects of the spell/ability to that weapon as long as the caster is in range, and has sufficient MP to maintain the effect. A Spirit may only target something within it's movement pattern before attacking, and their attack pattern afterwards. If a spell/ability is being used while attacking, depending on the target, may initiate the combat step. Spells and projectiles may be targeted like any other object in the enviornment.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Charging:

At any point during their turn an entity may focus and recharge their MP by sacrificing their SPD. They may not move nor attack after charging, even if they have Multistrike, or Vigilence. If MP is full, and they are not in combat, charging may instead restore HP, this is considered Resting. While Resting, an entity may deplete counters, and restore HP/MP, eventually returning stats to their base values at the cost of SPD. Resting may be used to eat/drink and plan tactics, shop with local entities, interact with other entities, and utilize the Forge. As long as combat is not initiated, and the entity does not leave the place they're resting, these interactions do not interrupt the rest.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building:

This is where an entity may construct objects using the forge, with their collection of shards, allowing them to create structures, constructs, and objects with different shapes, sizes, and active/inert effects. Depending on an object's tier level it may be considered at different scales. An entity may create a construct at any tier level, up to their tier level from a number of componant objects in their posession. The larger and more complex the construct/object, the higher it's tier level is considered. An entity may not create or utilize constructs/objects beyond their tier level. They can however make and use the componant parts for another entity to build the higher tier construct/object, or to build themselves once the have achieved the apropriate tier level. Buildings use their construct's SPD to determine their internal space, which may then be populated with other constructs/objects. SPD used in this way is reduced from the construct's total as long as it is being considered a building. Vehicles work in the same way, but may also move around the map. Varying in shape, size and utility, depending on their componant parts, their tier level, and assignment of SPD in exchange for space. Any construct/object with tier level [MediateI] and above, while being considered a building, may be used as a portal location.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Training:

While training with a new skill, you may apply it's base values as if using that base skill. During training an entity may not be destroyed, but they may not destroy a target either. The new skill may only be used outside training once the entity has obtained 1000 points toward that skill, at which point it may be used normally. An entity may only train another entity in a skill they have, and may only learn new skills from entities with those skills. Entities may be generated with skills in any location that would be indicitive of those skills, or with skills that may be indicitive of that entity. During Training an entity may fail if their HP falls to 0, and succeed if the trainer's HP falls to 0. If the entity fails they receive no points in that skill for that session. During training only the desired skill may be used in conjunction with the entity's basic traits and stats, if another skill is used then the session is a failure. There is no limit to the number of skills which can be obtained in this way. Custom class skills may also be taught/learned in this way after being created in the forge.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Trade:

Under most circumstances entities may exchange Mono for essences, shards, and objects. In some locations, or within some factions, there may be objects that are used as currency. These objects may be obtained through trade with entities in those locations or within those factions. these objects may be created from any shards and traded for different values depending on their shard cost. Some entities will trade with both Mono and their local currency object, but others may have no understanding of what Mono is, and will refuse to trade using it. When entering a location that uses a speciffic set of objects as currency, you may exchange an ammount of Mono for that currency depending on it's shard value. Entities that use both Mono, and the local currency may trade Mono for that currency, depending on how much they have, their personality, loyalty values, and interactions during the exchange. In some instances, depending on the entity, they may charge more or less when exchanging currency objects for Mono in this way. Once the currency object has been obtained, it may be used for exchange with any entity that uses that currency object. Currency objects may only be generated by, or with permission from, speciffic entities within that faction, or from that location, as determined by the leaders and people of the same.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gravity:

Any Spirit may move in multiple dimensions, as such it would be reasonable to assume they could also fall. When a Spirit moves away from a surface with no footing, it will begin to fall on the next turn if it is unable to regain it's footting. You determine how many spaces a Spirit falls in a turn based on their SPD. They may also use SPD to change direction while falling. If the distance they fall is higher than their DEF the difference is reduced from the Spirit's HP. If the Spirit is far enough from an space object there is no gravity, but there are no surfaces to use as footing either. Any Spirit with Flying may ignore Gravity while casting the effect.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Space:

It is impossible to breathe in Space without wearing some kind of suit, or being in some kind of ship. As such any Spirit in Space takes damage equal to half their own ATK each turn. The only way to move while in space is by falling away from something like a spell or a gun shot. If you are near a gravitational body, within the range of that object's SPD, and start moving toward it, you will continue falling until you land unless otherwise stopping. If contacting and object from a fall all objects and entities in range take damage equal to the disatance fallen in a radius equal to half that.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Orbit:

If an object starts falling around another object in space, it will begin to orbit. Orbit is treated like falling, where the object's SPD determines the distance it travels per turn. Depending on how close it is to the object it's orbiting, it will take more or less time to complete a full revolution. This applies to small objects, planetoids, stars, galaxies, and all other structures as tier levels increase. A space object's DEF squared determines it's surface area, and it's ATK squared determines how fast it rotates. Each point in ATK divided by tier level represents a 45 degree rotation. The timescale of a space object does not represent cosmic time as determined by the base time system. Some space objects may have multiple day/night cycles in a single cosmic day, or multiple orbits in a single cosmic year. This does not effect cosmic time, signs, nor Species/Type as determined by cosmic time. If an object breaks orbit, and falls into another space object, the total distance traveled in the previous turn, and the turn it breaks orbit, determins damage calculation. If a space object breaks orbit moving away from another space object, it will continue to travel into space as if it's falling in that direction until it is stopped, or it enters the range of another space object with greater mass. To determine which object has greater mass, check their shard value multiplied by tier level, objects with less mass may orbit objects with greater mass, but not the inverse.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rotation:

Any entity that can move, may rotate. Every 45 degree turn counts as one space multiplied by the apropriate tier level. This allows entities to change the angle of their attack pattern and navigate narrow hallways at the cost of SPD. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Particles:

Any single shard may be considered a particle. ATK shards may be considered like Electrons, DEF shards may be considered like Protons, SPD shards may be considered like Neutrons, HP shards may determine particle density, and MP shards may determine reactivity. Bio shards may be considered chemical bonds depending on Materia and Runes present in the enviornment. When enough shards come together, they may be considered materials/materia and treated like any standard material/materia. The effects of these material/materia are to be determined by their componant parts, and chemical bonds. If a material/materia would break down the chemical bonds of an entity's structure, then it may cause a Poison effect, modulated by the chemical bonds it's breaking down. If a chemical reaction would be exothermic, it may deal Burn damage based on the chemical bonds causing the reaction. All other effect shards may be produced in this way, and later extracted by an entity with the apropriate tier level.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Battle Board:

You may move anwhere along your movement pattern outside combat. When attacking you may use your attack pattern.

A system of overlaping Layers, within which the different versions of each enviornment exist for each player.

The Layers are as follows;

A) X - Y - Z
B) Y - Z - Q
C) Z - Q - X
D) Q - X - Y

You can move up and down fields, from A to D, or from B to C, for example.
In this way you can have multiple parallel dimensions, with both similar and wildly different characteristics.

Using this mechanic accounts for when groups of players split up, Each having vastly different experiences in the same locations.

Both sets of experiences happened, so those players can have, say, a temple and deep forest in the same location. While you can not be in both the deep forest, and the temple at the same time, you can move between both the temple and the forest using the mechanics of the Q board.

This allows Rememberence to account for one of the biggest problems in major D&D campaigns, without ever needing a dungeon master to formulate how to bring the different worlds back together.

The best way to synchronize with another player on a different plane, is to just move back and fourth, or abandon one iteration of that place entirely. Not only compensating the above stated issue, but also allowing integration and cooperation cross dimensionally. In the same way you can cooperate between towns, if you have three cities in the same location, then that becomes much easier.

The basic board pattern replicates across dimensions. From within a Bright plane all planes that connect on a face are Shaddow. All planes that connect on an edge or a point are also Bright. There are innumerable iterations of each plane with mild differences. Each bright character has 6 perfect Shadows, and each Shaddow has 6 perfect Brights depending on their plane of origin. There is a total of 36 perfect iterations of any/all objects, and beyond that range the divergences multiply becoming vastly different as you move from plane to plane, in much the same way you would transition from a building to a forest or a forest to a lake.

Unfortunately for us as players, this opens the potential for NPCs to confront us by exploiting dimensional weaknesses in our constructs and civilizations, but that's just part of the game, so use your imagination and devise the most powerful interdimensional civilization you can muster.

The Battle Board can also be used as a chart for reference purposes. For example, you can take a single quadrant, apply two Classes to it, and find the Skill combinations between those classes. Alternatively you can use the full board for cross referencing possible combinations of Signs, or multiple boards (2x3) to find the possible Species/Type Combinations. 

2x2 for finding possible Type/Sign combinations, and Cross Types. 3x3 for finding possible Species/Skill combinations, and Cross Breeds. There are no restrictions on how you reference the charts, and few restrictions to how you impliment those combinations. This makes finding new ways of combining the componants of the game much easier to follow.

Any chart combination may be selected from at random, by throwing bones, depending on the circumstances, which gives players more control of how things generate in the world around them, by manipulating the variables, making even generic worlds more lively.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Narritive:

Starting from any verse, and progressing to other verses using the Matrix. This is the backbone of generating random quest lines. By default, Bright entities start in the prologue, and a Shadow entities start in the Epilogue. Progressing up and to the right if their State has been mostly positive at the end of a Cycle, or down and to the left if it has been mostly negative. An NPC could be anywhere in their story, determined by Throwing Bones. Based on an entity's Biorhythms, Loyalty rating, and the story, they may make different requests of you, or take different actions. Offering rewards to be negotiated, assistence with something they're working on, chasing someone out of town, searching for lost love. Anything from becoming your eternal servant, to stabbing you in the back for their own gain. This will be completly unique for each character, in every playthrough, as different things come together to form your own special story.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Food and Drink:

Each actor in a game loses 10% of their maximum HP/MP every day, they are capped at this value until they otherwise replenish themselves. An actor with 100 max HP will lose 10 HP/day. This is to help prevent over population, and create a more balanced sense of resource management. Don't worry, you'll be producing all the goods you need in no time.

By converting any combination of material and/or materia, you can create a plethora of Consumable Items. Food Items restore HP and may carry any effects of the source compound. Drink Items restore MP and may carry any effects of the source compound. Casting Items uses SPD equal to the Tier Level of the item. If it is a Level 10 Item, it takes 10 SPD to use. A Consumable Item is destroyed on use, and may be produced for the Shard Cost of it's components, as long as the crafter has the required shards and is the appropriate level to craft the recipe. Consumable Items may be sold for their Shard Cost as long as the buyer has enough Monetary Essence to purchase them. 

Consumable Items are the backbone of any thriving economy, and if you want to get the essence shards to craft certain items, you need to build with other Spirits and increase your Faction's production.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thoughts:

These ratings are changed depending on the current state of the entity. When preforming checks that use EGO or FND, For example, you would adjust the Env of a spirit higher or lower. Depending on the check, it will affect the entity either positively or negatively.

An entity's State is determined by adding all of their thought parameters together. A positive state indicates the entity has a doing well, and a negative state would indicate it is not. Some entities are more difficult to please than others, and some are impossible to please at all. Others still may seem like nothing could bring them down. An entity's thought parameters may be added to any interaction that shares Biorythms with it. Each thought parameter may change the way an entity interacts, and which actions it takes. Every interaction produces Thought counters in the apropriate thought parameter, the number of which being reduced by 1 each turn, thus weakening the effect on the entity until they reach their base values. Negative counters cancel Positive counters in the same thought paraemter. Different interactions will be favored by entities that get a positive state change from that interation, but may prefer actions that have negative state changes if their overall state is negative. 

	Enviornment: EGO - FND
How an entity responds to it's enviornment. If EGO is higher than FND it will tend to disregard the enviornment. If FND is higher than EGO they will tend to observe it more easily. 

	Emotion: DIV - BEU
How an entity handles it's emotions. If DIV is higher than BEU it will tend to have less control of it's emotions. If BEU is higher than FND it will tend to have more.

	Subconscious: UND - SPL
How suggestable and entity is. If UND is higher than SPL the entity may be difficult to control and more individualistic. If SPL is higher than UND the entity may be much easier to control and more collectivist.

	Conscious: SEX - MNF
Whether the entity is active or passive. If SEX is higher than MNF the entity will tend to be less productive and take fewer actions. If MNF is higher than SEX the entity will tend to maximize the actions it takes each turn.

	Abstraction: WIS - KNO
Whether the entity uses knowledge gained through experience, or through education. If WIS is higher than KNO the entity will tend to lean on their personal experiences. If KNO is higher than WIS the entity will tend to lean on knowledge gained through study or research.

	Perception: STR - VIT
How the entity is presented with things outside itself. If STR is higher than VIT the entity may consider things as merely objects and utilities. If VIT is higher than STR the entity may consider things as stories or narratives.

Each parameter may be considered at any time if an interaction shares a Biorythm with it. The value of the Thought parameter may be added to the value of the Biorythm it shares with the interaction. For example, Humor interactions may be adjusted by both Abstraction and Emotion. Abstraction effecting WIS, and Emotion effecting DIV. Each Interaction is connected to two Thought parameters in this way. As Thought parameters are adjusted by the outcomes of interactions, interactions are effected by Thought parameters. As more counters are acumulated, and Loyalty is adjusted by the results of each interaction, other interactions may become easier or more difficult. An entity's State value may be added to their Loyalty value for a given actor at the end of an interaction check.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Relations:

Depending on how you interact with a Spirit they will treat you differently. Each Spirit has an initial Loyalty rating of 0, which you can build over time by interacting with them. Each interaction changes your Loyalty by a number of points equal to the difference in Bio-data between the actors. The maximum Loyalty is 100 and the minimal Loyalty is -100 Changing with each interaction. Once you have reached +/- 100 loyalty to a Spirit, you can advance your Loyalty Ranking with that spirit. The higher your Loyalty Ranking with a certain actor, the more likely they are to aid you in various ways on your journey. Loyalty Rankings below -10 however, may result in noncompliance, or even hostility.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gender and Sexuality:

	Each spirit may take many forms depending on their combination of Signs, Species, and Type. However there is another layer of aestetic and biology. While creating your character you may choose a value between -100 and 100 for each of the following. Alternatively you may follow the Biorhythms and throw bones for these values. The value on either side is compared to the value in the middle and those resulting values are then compared. Values on the left are treated as negative numbers. These calculations may only occur once when an entity is created, or otherwise chosen for the entity by the player.

	Expression; (EGO - UND - SPL)
		Masculine <-> Feminine.
		With 0 being Androgenous.

	Aestetic; (MNF - KNO - SEX)
		Heterosexual <-> Homosexual.
		With 0 being Bisexual.

	Imperative; (STR - DIV - BEU)
		Inseminator <-> Incubator.
		With 0 being Asexual.

	Attraction; (VIT - WIS - FND)
		Heterogenous <-> Homogenous.	
		With 0 being Non-genous.

	Expression determines how the entity represents it's gender. Aestetic determines which expression the entity is attracted to. Imperative determines weather the entity produces or fertilizes eggs. Attraction determines if the entity is attracted to the same or different Biological Imperatives.

	Any offspring produced by two actors will tend to adopt these traits from either parent depending on their Biorhythms. Offspring may only be produced by an Incubator and an inseminator. Unless the parent entity is otherwise both.

	This coupled with the breeding mechanics can produce diverse complex societies ranging from tyrannical matriarchies to benevolent harems and everything inbetween and beyond. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Breeding:

You may breed any two compatible Spirits. Their Loyalty to one another must exceed 60 and their Biological Imperative must be inversed to be a potential pair. When breeding two spirits you compare the SEX of each spirit to their partner's BEU. Two parents with identical stats, for the sake of simplicity, each with SEX = 4 and BEU = 6. SEX is subtracted from BEU, in this case 2 each, or a final number of Turn Cycles before there is an offspring (4). 

Once the breeding pair has produced a child, the child takes the highest stats from each parent. If one parent has ATK = 5 and the other has ATK = 4 then the child has ATK = 5. This is true for all combat and noncombat stats. In this way you can create and blend new kinds of spirits. If the breeding pair is of different Species, the offspring is then considered a "Cross Breed," who may have a maximum of Two species, taking the highest values from each species. If the breeding pair is of different Types, the offspring are then considered "Cross Type" and granted both Types, ignoring identical Biorhythms on the same combat stat.

The offspring takes on the highest Biorhythms from each parent, as well as their own Signs. Breeding spirits can create more powerful combinations, and allows you to forge your own genetic lineage. Alternatively you could create a cross type, cross breed who is in search of their parents, or their kind. Forged from the depths of a mad doctor's laboratory. Spawned from divine beings to serve a purpose. The possibilities are limitless.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Factions:

Each Species and Type is treated as a faction. Being of a species or a Type raises your Loyalty rating with all actors of the same Species by 10 and same Type by 5. These values are doubled if you share one or more of the same Signs but halved if you share one or more opposing Signs.

You gain faction loyalty by interacting with actors of that faction. Loyalty points between actors add/subtract faction loyalty as well. You may encounter randomly generated factions, which you can attempt to join, or create your own factions, to which you may recruit Spirits or other players. 

Only after a Spirit's Loyalty Ranking is greater than +10 will they join your faction. Icons (Player Characters) may join a faction after establishing +10 Loyalty Ranking with that faction. If your Loyalty Ranking is less than -10 with a faction, they may disband you. If a Spirit falls below a Loyalty Ranking less than -10 with your faction they may leave.

Once you have achieved +100 Loyalty to a faction, or another Spirit has +100 Loyalty to your faction, you can advance Loyalty Ranking with that faction or spirit. Each +/- 100 Loyalty is a Loyalty Rank, for or against that faction, and is tiered as normal levels. Tier appropriate Loyalty Ranking with a faction is required to purchase certain constructs from that faction.

[NoviceI] Is available to all members, while [BeginnerI] is Rank 10 plus, and so on. The inverse is also possible when forming deep rivalries, and vehement enemies.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Resurrection:

The process of reviving a spirit after it has been defeated can be a bit difficult. If you die, you must face a Shadow, a perfect clone of your Icon in every way. You may resurrect in one of Two ways; Fight your Shadow, and win, Respawn, done. You get a duplicate of your own essence. If you fight your Shadow, and your Shadow wins, you lose $Mono equal to your spirit's base shard value multiplied by your level. A Spirit with HP/ATK/DEF/SPD/MP = 15/3/3/3/15 would be worth $3900 at level 10. If you do not have enough $Mono after losing, you are considered in "Limbo" Until another spirit decides to pay for you, or you overcome your Shadow. You may still use Spirits in "Limbo" within "The Gateway" They may not enter any generated worlds, but they may still interact with other spirits within "The Gateway" It is possible for a spirit to escape Limbo using an item that teleports them to a specific place, a portal opened by another spirit, or through a pocket universe between places. Once you have left Limbo in this way, you are given a Karmic Debt equal to your shard value, and your Shadow may hunt you outside the gateway until the debt is paid. If you die again after escaping "The Gateway" you must return to "Limbo" and face your Shadow again.

Alternativly, you may become the Shadow, After losing the battle with it. In which case, the game is played as if your loyalties are reversed. Friends become enemies, enemies become friends. If you die while playing a Shadow, you battle a Purified Bright version of the character instead. The same rules apply, and you may switch between both versions of the character by dying. After losing the battle with a Purified Bright version of the character you may reverse their role in game again, returning loyalties to normal. This process doesn't grant a duplicate of your character's essence.

Although you may come and go from "the Gateway" after leaving Limbo as a Purified Bright or Corrupt Shadow character, it would be financially wise to avoid dying as much as possible.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Keys:

A key is a small code, that Represents a specific combination of things in game. It can activate a specific device using the same code, change portal locations, and summon token creatures. It could even represent speciffic weapons, gear, abilities, and constructs. A simple example would be 1 1 10 10, or Rat, Aries, Grimm, Fiend. A key generated with this code may open any lock with the same code, summon a token to aid a spirit, represent a unique construct, or if used on a portal, link to a corresponding world inhabited by 1 1 10 10. The Numbers in order represent an objects' Animal, Stars, Species, and Type respectively. More complex codes can be generated by adding specific Skill combinations, Melee, Ranged, Magic, Step, Special, and Trance. The Acrobat Step for example would be 0 0 0 4 0 0 as code. The more specific the object, the more complex the key. 

1 1 10 10
2 0 3 2 0 3

You now have the combination to a more specific Grimm Fiend, or perhaps a group of them. A world inhabited by them, an entire universe built especially for them, all the way from a single tribe on a barren planet, to an interdimensional empire, every thing in between and beyond is within your grasp, using only this one complete code.

You may also choose a code at random and have fun building worlds with your friends. The minimum input is 0 0 0 0 which is N/A, an endless blank space called "The Gateway," The maximum input is 12 12 36 24. This framework leaves nearly limitless possibilities for your worlds to expand and grow with a little influence and imagination from you. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Forge:

When crafting in the forge you are breaking down essences into their base components, and mixing them with others to become stronger or improve your gear. There are multiple ways to fragment an essence, which lets you create completely new things during gameplay.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Essences and Shards:

Every spirit you destroy may be collected as an essence, those essences and how you use them will ultimately determine your success.

Each essence consists of several parts, called shards. These shards are separated into groups based on what aspects of a spirit they effect. Spirit shards, carrying the Species or Type data of a spirit. Zodiac shards, which carry the Animal or Star sign data of a spirit. Combat shards, which carry HP/ATK/DEF/SPD/MP data. Rhythm shards, which contain the Bio-data of a spirit. Effect shards, which carry the effect text of Attributes and Abilities. Mobility shards, which control how a spirit moves or attacks. Lastly there are Skill shards, which carry the Class Skill data of a spirit.

Species: <---\_ Spirit Shards.
Type:    <---/

Animal: <---\_ Zodiac Shards.
Stars:  <---/

HP/ <---\
ATK/     \
DEF/      Combat shards.
SPD/     /
MP/ <---/

MNF/ <---\
SPL/      \
BEU/       \
STR/        \
FND/         \
KNO/          \__ Rhythm Shards.
UND/          /
WIS/         /
VIT/        /
SEX/       /
DIV/      /
EGO/ <---/

Ability:   <---\__ Effect Shards.
Attribute: <---/

Move:   <----\__ Mobility Shards.
Attack: <----/

Melee/  <---\
Ranged/      \
Magic/        \__ Skill Shards.
Step/         /
Special/     /
Trance/ <---/

These shards can be used in various ways depending on how you craft them in the Forge. Something like a simple fireball spell would use a pyro type spirit shard, a mobility shard to determine how it moves, say diagnal, and a few ATK shards to give it a kick. The resulting ability in this case would be a pyro type ATK boost, with a specific movement pattern, but MUCH more complex things can be created in this process, called "Infusing,"

Alternatively, if you want to collect shards from an essence, you have to "Diffuse" it. 

Shards are diffused from essence as follows:

Essence -> 
	Spirit/Zodiac/Skill ->
		Combat/Rhythm/Effect/Mobility

The largest shards are Zodiac, Spirit, and Skill shards, while the smallest shards are Rhythm and Combat shards. You could collect each piece of any essence as shards. Spirit, Zodiac, Combat, Rhythm, Effect, Mobility, and Skill shards, may all be extracted from an essence at a 1:1 ratio. A spirit with ATK = 10, can be diffused for 10 ATK shards, in addition to all other shards it may contain.

You may exchange your shards for $Mono, Monetary Essence, at a 1:10 ratio for Combat/Rhythm shards, 10 ATK shards = $100 Mono. 1:100 For Effect/Mobility shards, 10 Diagnal shards = $1k Mono. Alternatively you may do the reverse and charge Monetary Essence in exchange for shards. $100 = 10 Combat/Rhythm Shards. $1k = 10 Effect/Mobility Shards. This may not be done with Spirit/Zodiac/Skill shards, due to their higher levels of complexity. Instead, for higher shards you don't already have, you may buy their Shard Recipe for $10k each. You must have a recipe for the kind of shard you are trying to make in order to tune your $Mono to the correct shards. Recipes can be purchased from NPCs, or obtained through crafting with shards you already posses.

Shard costs are multiplied by the applied tier level. Due to the higher power of the constructs and equipment being created, their effects being multiplied by their level, which is increased through the primary leveling system, makes the strain for infusing and diffusing them far greater.

Different spirits may have different rates for different shards, or be willing to pay different prices for full essences, depending on how rare they are in that particular area, and whether or not the spirit needs those shards for something they're doing. A warrior might pay more $Mono for ATK shards as an example.

Higher level spirits will be collecting more shards, as the essences they collect will be stronger, thus yielding more shards when Diffused. Depending on whether or not you have reached the apropriate tier level, determines what tier essences you can infuse. Unit tier essences take more shards to build than Icons, World tier essences take more shards to build than Units, and so on, Considering the structured scaling system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructs:

Essences are the very fabric of a spirit, in energy form, and the primary crafting materials. From which you can not only forge powerful weapons and gear, but also entirely new things, called "Constructs"

Such Constructs are created by using shards in certain ways. Let's create an example. We can take an Orc Species shard, let's say 20 HP/MP shards, and 5 ATK/DEF/SPD shards. This gives us a construct Orc with the following combat stats once infused;

HP = 20
ATK = 5
DEF = 5
SPD = 5
MP = 20

Which is a bit stronger than a standard base Orc essence. This construct is easily usable for walls, obsticles, furnature, and has no inherent ability. It is also a material that can be used in weapon and gear creation, but not a playable character in itself.

The number of possible materials for each different kind of Spirit shard are literally limitless. Keep in mind that this is just an example, and in game, you will have to collect the shards you are using, and get creative with how you're modifying them.

If you take this Orc material, add an effect shard, a mobility shard, and fuse them together, you have a completly new Construct Orc species. Simularly, Using Rhythm shards rather than Combat shards, and Type shards rather than Species shards, you can create completly new Construct Types as well. Using Rhythm Shards and Zodiac shards, you can create completly new Construct Signs. Construct skills work much the same way. By making various constructs, and linking them together, you can create completly unique Constructs that are both formidable, and customized to their very core to suit your particular needs.

If you need a plant that grows fast, and can be harvested for HP shards, doable. Or a kind of cattle you can heard for their durable hide, all this and more is possible by infusing and diffusing shards.

For example, Shards can be turned into weapons and gear. We could take our Orc material, and turn it into a weapon with +5/5/5 when equipped, or gear which may also increase HP/MP in addition to ATK/DEF/SPD. This allows the player's imagination to run wild as they collect more essences and create new things over time.

One may equip the following kinds of gear: Head, Body, Legs, Hands, Feet, and Other. All of which are up to the player's essence collection and imagination to create ^_^ 

If you're looking for magic that gets stronger as you do, or something that can pack a bigger punch, you can create your own spells and abilities. 

For example, you could take the Fireball above, and dump the ATK shards. We now have a diagnal pyro spell. First thing you will need is an Effect shard, in this case we're sticking with Pyro, and using Burn. Next you will need to choose the Rhythm shard you wish to use, which will control the damage and duration of the burn. Say you have 10 WIS, so using that, you now have a Diagonal Pyro BurnWIS spell, which deals 10 damage a turn for 10 turns, unless the target uses some kind of dispel. While a touch more complex, this Fireball spell, is FAR superior to the earlier example, and gives you more control over how the spell behaves as you increase your WIS using Sp. 

By using a Skill shard, you can change these effects into class speciffic abilities, which may only be used by Spirits with speciffic skills. Use these effects to enchant materials, giving them mystic powers. Or enhance your magics with material focus that will decimate your foes. Taking the time to consider if you want to be a flame warrior in orcish gear, Such as the examples provided would suggest, or an arctic Wolf wrapped in Troll hide, ultimately the choice is yours.

Force and Form:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		"Tech Path"

Material and Form Styles.

	Skill ->
		Material ->
			  Form Style.

(Species + Class/Skill)

	*There are 36 x 36 Form Styles. The use of Material substraits for weapons and abilities. This is the "Tech Path" where Spirits build constructs and equipment to supliment their abilities depending on their tier level, and use of shards.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		"Mage Path"

Materia and Force Styles.

	Skill ->
		Materia ->
			  Force Style.

(Type + Class/Skill)

	*There are 24 x 36 Force Styles. The use of Materia substraits for spells and abilities. This is the "Mage Path" where Spirits build enchantments and complex spells to supliment their skills depending on their tier level, and use of shards.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		"Sage Path"

Compounds and Arts.

	Forms ->
		Forces ->
			Arts.

(Species/Type + Class/Skill)

	*There are (36x36)x(24x36) Arts. The use of Materials, and Materia, to maximize both force and form. This is the "Sage Path" Where Spirits combine constructs and enchantments to suppliment their skills and abilities, depending on their tier level, and use of shards.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may follow any force and/or form tree, or none. Using this system you can better organize your skills and abilities into combinations of force and form. Refining your character into it's own series of unique Arts.

You start the game with one Species, one Type, and your Class Skills, your base. As you create weapons or gear with your base Material(Species) and spells or abilities with your base Materia(Type) you begin to build your own Forces and Forms by default, whether or not you're aware that's what you're doing. A skill slot that is occupied by an Art (Using a combination of Material/Materia in the blueprint) will naturally be stronger than a skill slot that only contains a single Force or Form.

You can go further by creating Skill Combos that are stonger than single Skills alone. There are a total of 36^6 Skill combos. As you can use any combination of two or more Skills together (Melee 1H + Special Blue, for example)

Mastery of a particular Skill and Art (Bastet Pyro Swords, for example) can be a potent advantage, but mastery of several (Bastet Pyro Swords + Bastet Pyro Blue, for example) can become overwhelming as the stats and effects stack. 

(Such as the Bastet "Guide" now being "Guide2", and Pyro "Burn" now being "Burn2" making both effects twice as strong, in addition to any base increase to combat stats, as long as both the 1H Melee Weapon and Blue Special are being used simultaniously, this rule inherently applies to all skill combos)

When it comes to Force and Form, or making your own Arts, it's a matter of getting creative, telling your character's story through the essences you collect, and the things you create. How those creations come together in the end, and the direction you choose is ultimately up to you. A Technical mastermind, a cunning mage, or a soldier who gets shit done, all that and more is possible with just a little imagination.

Material/Materia;

Manipulating the properties of physical materials and the flow of Materia to create devistating weapons, powerful abilities, armies, empires, and beyond.

Materials, and Species, are formulated with the following template; 

------------------------------------
28) Species Name; [Material Name]

[Description]

Species; Human

Traits; Indomitable, ATK and DEF are increased by STR.

HP = 15
ATK = 3
DEF = 3
SPD = 3
MP = 15

Move: Omni

------------------------------------

Materia, and Type, are formulated with the folloing template;

------------------------------------
16) Type Name; [Materia Name]

[Description]

Type; Normal

Traits; Battle-Cry, Target allied Spirit gains ATK/DEF/SPD equal to the caster's STR.

------------------------------------

Each Species/Material is granted up to 39 points for all stats, Each Type is granted one Bio Controller for each stat. Both are then multiplied by Tier Level, depending on the crafter's shard collection and imagination, in addition to any other properties the base Material/Materia may have. When mixing Materials and Materia they are considered Compounds operating under the same rules as Cross Breeds for Compound Materials and Cross Types for Compound Materia.

Weapons and Abilities may be created from any combination Material/Materia, for any combination of Skill Slots available to the crafter. They use the following template;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Biorhythms"

Every facet of your Spirit has rhythms and flows. Swaying their ability to communicate, gain favor, or influence desires. Among other things. This is a quick run-down. ~_^
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) MNF = Manifestation, A Spirit's ability to take action. Spirits with higher MNF will often take action when others will not. Inversely Spirits wih low MNF will tend to be indecisive, prefering to follow, rather than lead.

2) SPL = Splendor, The Ability of a Spirit to invoke awe. Spirits with highter SPL like to be the center of attention with flashy clothes, or abilities. Inversely Spirits with low SPL tend to be bland, and blend in more easily.

3) BEU = Beauty, The beauty/purity of the Spirit. Spirits high in BEU tend to be more couragous and nurturing, more to do with inner beauty. Inversely Spirits with low BEU tend to be less willing to help others with an almost callous regard for their suffering.

4) STR = Strength, Relates to a Spirit's force of will. Spirits high in STR have incredible will power, standing in the face of certain death when others might not. Inversely Spirits low in STR tend to be more timid and willing to follow others who they feel might protect them.

5) FND = Foundation, Represents the stability of the Spirit. Spirits high in FND tend to stand on principle willing to sacrifice themselves or others for their cause. Inversely Spirits low in FND will change their stances on a whim, being more willing to change sides or turn on their allies.

6) KNO = Knowledge, A Spirit's drive toward profound truths. Spirits high in KNO are those who seek information at nearly any cost, knowing being the reward in and of itself. Inversely Spirits low in KNO tend to come across as more air headed, and willing to embrace their own ignorance.

7) UND = Understanding, A Spirit's Problem solving and compassion towards others. Spirits high in UND learn how others think and feel quickly, even if they don't share those sentiments personally. Inversely Spirits low in UND will have almost complete disregaurd for the disposition of others, not really caring what they think or feel one way or another.
	
8) WIS = Wisdom, Determines how deeply a Spirit contemplates situations. Spirits high in WIS have seen more than their fair share of experiences, learning how to reason their way through situations more easily. Inversely Spirits low in WIS may tend to be naieve and impulsive, opting instead to jump right in and see what happens, even to their own detriment.
	
9) VIT = Virtue, The degree to which a Spirit will honor it's convictions. Spirits high in VIT will almost always stand by their word, even if it could get them killed, and detest lying. Inversely Spirits low in VIT will be more likely to swindle and steal if given the chance, without a regard for what effect that might have on the world around them.

10) SEX = Sexuality, The level of sexuality within the Spirit. Spirits high in SEX will tend to be more sensual, often being more flirtatious, even when it may be unwarranted. inversely Spirits low in SEX will tend to be more reclusive when it comes to intimacy, and more exclusive in their partnerships, if they have any at all.

11) DIV = Divinity, How close the Spirit is to it's divine nature. Spirits high in DIV have a direct connection to their divine nature, often thinking in more essiterric terms, and seeking to stregnthen that connection. Inversely Spirits low in DIV tend to be more atheistic and materialistic opting instead to leave those kind of contemplations behind as a kind of hinderence.

12) EGO = Ego, The Spirit's sense of self. Spirits with high EGO tend to be more self involved, seeing themselves as all important, or superior in some way. Inversely Spirits low in EGO tend to leave themselves out of their considerations even when it is directly harmful to themselves.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bio-States/Interactions:

	Depending on the difference between the caster, and the target, Loyalty and State values will be higher or lower.

Each combination of Bio-data is treated as "ATK" and "DEF" in any given interaction for both participants. The first bio-controller being "ATK" and the second being "DEF" with Loyalty being treated as "HP" in any given interaction. Increasing or decreasing depending on how the interaction goes.

Ex. 1: If (Caster's DIV) > (Target's WIS) by 2, telling a stale joke, the target will gain 2 loyalty to the caster. Likewise, the reverse would cause a loss of 2 loyalty. 

Ex. 2: If (Target's DIV) > (Caster's WIS) by 2, hearing a stale joke, the caster will gain 2 loyalty to the target. Like above, the reverse would cause a loss in the caster's loyalty.

In both instances, each of the target and the caster have their own loyalty rating for each other participant. As the conversation continues, the loyalty between the actors will increase until they each reach max, or inversely reach the minimum of -30, where actors may become hostile.

Alternatively, You can get a glimpse into the personality of an actor by comparing their own bio-data internally. If their WIS and DIV are equal, they don't have much of a sense of humor naturally. This can be done with every interaction/state to help you better understand the personality of the spirit you're talking to, without affecting the loyalty ratings of that actor.

These interactions may also be randomized with dice to automate the process, instead of choosing each interaction individually, or when choosing interactions from entities you do not control. Loyalty ratings between entities may vastly change socio political landscapes, cultures, and the kinds of people living in a given location.

The Biorythms of which are determined by the time of their origin in a given location, and changed over time based on mating habits and Zodiac alignments. This data is typically computed randomly by throwing bones while exploring enviornments and interacting with entities.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-Humor; (DIV - WIS)
	If Divinity > Wisdom, the target may be amused.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2-Faith; (VIT - WIS)
	If Virtue > Wisdom, the target may have faith. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3-Fortune; (WIS - VIT) 
	If Wisdom > Virtue, the target may gain favor.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4-Illusion; (VIT - MNF) 
	If Virtue > Manifestation, the target may be mislead.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5-Judgment; (SPL - MNF) 
	If Splendor > Manifestation, the target may pass Judgement.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
6-Patience; (STR - SPL) 
	If Strength > Splendor, the target may be patient.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
7-Will; (UND - STR)
	If Understanding > Strength, the target may have indomitable will.

Evens/Odds, Heads/Tails, answers Yes/No questions, and selects between pairs.

You may use any equivilent set of dice and "Throw Bones" for any combat or status check to improve, or hinder, you chances of sucess. This also increases or decreases the resulting outcome of those checks, including an element of chance into gameplay.

The resulting values can be multiplied by tier level for any interaction, which allows the dice to modulate for every layer of game play.

Throwing bones allows even weaker spirits a slim chance of victory against overwhelming opponents, and gives things a more natural feel, where even the tiniest mouse could carry a plague that can topple giants.

Rememberence plays well without throwing bones, but the element of chance always makes things more interesting. Take a risk, and throw bones, or play it safe, and avoid the spirit that has an advantage on you, your call.

Intelligent, charming, and ambitious, they are more often than not triumphant as businessmen. Rats are self-contained and do not discuss their problems with others. Even though they can be talkative sometimes, they never confide in anyone. They are energetic and great organizers; so if you want something done, call in a Rat. They are suited to careers in shop keeping, sales, buying and selling, or accountancy. Rats shine in managerial positions. In partnership, Rats are faithful if their partner is able to provide safety, assurance, and love that they need. They are not romantic by nature, but are very caring and loving.

1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018, 2030, 2042

This is the most forthright, friendly, and sincere sign of all. Spirits under this sign always seem to be up for work and fun equally. This quality earns them respect from everyone around them. They are prone to being brave and courageous, and they rarely take back any commitment or betray the trust of a loved one. Their inner strength and physical intensity make them an excellent choice to have in a workplace environment. They are very truthful and honorable, and in relationships, they will settle with someone who stands up for them completely. They work hard for the welfare of others and are patient listeners. They can be very faithful when it comes to their partners and to others around them. They are good at teaching, social work, counseling, medicine, research, public campaigning, and law.

1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019, 2031, 2043

Spirits under this sign are hospitable, honorable, and mellow. They have a really high threshold of tolerance. They are well-liked for their truthfulness and warmth. They are always finding qualities in others and believe that everyone has a right to hold their own point of view. They are often overflowing with the blessing of wealth and the support of their friends and colleagues. However, they are not bothered about accumulating wealth. They can be satisfied with a modest lifestyle. They rarely find faults in others and are not vengeful; thus, they don't have any enemies. They accept the lifestyle that they have and are content with that. They do not demand extravagance. They enjoy simple and natural happiness. In relationships, they are often the giver of love and affection and believe that they will receive the same. They have a strong sense of determination and if they set their minds on a task, they tend to pursue it and attain it. Good career options are in music, food, writing, social work, gardening, and nursing.

Keep reading and you will know...

------------------------------------

Each Star sign is divided into halfs corresponding to Type.

------------------------------------
1) Constellation Aries; [Creative]

March 21 - April 19

Aries Spirits are creative, adaptive, and insightful. They can also be strong-willed and spontaneous (sometimes to a fault). Aries Spirits can be driven and are very ambitious often making them over-achievers in anything they set their mind to tackle. Aries are fire Spirits, and so too is their personality. They may be quick to anger, but don't take it personally, it's just their fiery, passionate personalities showing through. Aries Spirits have excellent sense of humor, and they get along with almost everyone at the party (and they DO know how to party). Aries can be impatient, but we love them anyway because they are devoted friends, lovers and family members - they are loyal to the end and will fight for their causes (usually supporting the underdog).

Types:

Vortex, MP + KNO

------------------------------------
2) Constellation Taurus; [Stubborn]

April 20 - May 20

Taurus Spirits and their traits, like the animal that represents them, are all about strength, stamina and will. Stubborn by nature, the Taurus will stand their ground to the bitter end (sometimes even irrationally so). But that's okay because the Taurus is also a loving, sympathetic and appreciative Spirit. The Taurus is very understanding and when we need someone to unburden ourselves to, we often share our deepest fears with the Taurians of the zodiac. Taurians are very patient, practical and efficient, they are excellent in matters of business and are also wonderful instructors/teachers. Although initially they may have their own best interest at heart, they are ultimately & endlessly generous with their time, possessions and love.

Types:

Beast,   MP + STR

------------------------------------
3) Constellation Gemini; [Flexable]

May 21 - June 20

Flexibility, balance and adaptability are the keywords for the Gemini. They are quick to grasp the meaning of a situation and act on it, often with positive effects. They tend to have a duality to their nature, and can sometimes be tough to predict how they will react. They can turn from hot to cold and may be prone to noticeable mood swings. However, they are generous Spirits with tendencies of being affectionate, and imaginative. They also inspire others easily as they seem to naturally motivate themselves - their charisma and accomplishments are infectious. Geminians are very supportive, and are especially good at promotions, sales, and driving hard bargains.

Types:

Undead, MP + EGO

------------------------------------
4) Constellation Cancer; [Reserved]

June 21 - July 22

Cancerians love home-life, family and domestic settings. They are traditionalists, and enjoy operating on a fundamental level. They love history, and are fascinated with the beginnings of things (heraldry, ancestry, etc.). The moon is their ruler, so they can be a bit of a contradiction and sometimes moody. However, they are conservative, so they'll be apt to hide their moods from others altogether. They have a reputation for being fickle, but they'll tell you that isn't true, and it's not. Cancerians make loyal, sympathetic friends. However Cancerians need alone time, and when they retreat, let them do so on their terms.

MNF = 5
SPL = 4
BEU = 3
STR = 4

Types: 
Crystal, HP + FND
Ghost,   MP + FND

------------------------------------
5) Constellation Leo; [Expanded]

July 23 - August 22

The Spirit of Leo is about expanse, power and exuberance. Leo's are natural born leaders, and they will let you know it as they have a tendency to be high-minded and vocal about their opinions. That's okay, because if you observe, the Leo is usually correct in his/her statements. Leo's have a savvy way of analyzing a situation and executing swift judgment with a beneficial outcome. It comes from being a leader. They are brave, intuitive, and also head-strong and willful. Beneath their dynamic persona lies a generous, loving, sensitive nature that they do not easily share with others. They might be a bit bossy, but those who know them understand this comes from a source need to do good, not (usually) from an inflated ego.

MNF = 6

EGO = 4

Colors: Red/Green

Types: 
Blood, HP + MNF
Pyro,  MP + MNF

------------------------------------
6) Constellation Virgo; [Intuitive]

August 23 - September 22

Virgo's have keen minds, and are delightful to chat with, often convincing others of outlandish tales with ease and charm. Virgo's are inquisitive and are very skilled at drawing information from others. This trait also makes them naturally intuitive. Combine this with their remarkable memories, and we see an advanced, analytical personality. However the Virgo needs balance in their lives otherwise they may become short-tempered, impatient and self-serving. Virgo's are excellent teammates in work and social activities. They work well with others, although they freely express their opinions (even when unwarranted).

MNF = 5

Types: 
Psychic,     HP + SPL
Spellcaster, MP + SPL

------------------------------------
7) Constellation Libra; [Balanced]

September 23 - October 22

As the nature of their Spirit and it's meanings would indicate, Libra's are all about balance, justice, equanimity and stability. They easily surround themselves with harmony and beauty, but sometimes go to extremes to do so if their goals are unreasonable or unhealthy. With Venus as their ruling planet, Libra's are very understanding, caring, and often the champion of underdogs. They have keen intuitions, but often don't give themselves enough credit for their perceptions. They can be quiet and shy if not persuaded to come out of their shell. Ironically and in spite of their introverted nature they make excellent debaters, often proving a point from out of seemingly nowhere.

Biorhythms:
MNF = 4
SPL = 5
BEU = 6
STR = 1
FND = 3

Types: 
Holy,  HP + BEU
Curse, MP + BEU

------------------------------------
8) Constellation Scorpio; [Unshaken]

October 23 - November 21

The Scorpio is often misunderstood. These personalities are bold and are capable of executing massive enterprises with cool control and confidence. They can surmount seemingly all obstacles when they put their mind to the task, and they have unshakable focus when the situation calls for it. Regardless of their bold nature, they are often secretive, but they are always observing behind their withdrawn manner. Being associated with the sun, they are not withdrawn for long, and when they come out again they do so with force, vigor and determination. It is true, Scorpio's can be argumentative and pack a powerful sting, but that's simply because they see all opposition as a healthy challenge.

Biorhythms:
MNF = 3
SPL = 4
BEU = 5
STR = 0
FND = 2
KNO = 1

Types: 
Fiend,   HP + DIV
Thunder, MP + DIV

------------------------------------
9) Constellation Sagittarius; [Focused]

November 22 - December 21

Here we have the philosopher among the zodiac Spirits and meanings. Like the Scorpio, they have great ability for focus, and can be very intense. However, they must channel their energy or they will waste time and wear themselves out going in too many directions at once. They are not very patient and expect quick results. However, when encountered with failure they make extreme comeback's often against incredible odds. They make loyal friends and lovers, but they do not handle commitment well as they refuse to be tied down while chasing philosophical pursuits.

Biorhythms:
MNF = 2
SPL = 3
BEU = 4
STR = 1
FND = 1

EGO = 0

Color: White/Red

Types: 
Fairy,  HP + UND
Avatar, MP + UND

------------------------------------
10) Constellation Capricorn; [Practical]

December 22 - January 19

Capricorn's are also philosophical Spirits and are highly intelligent. They apply their knowledge to practical matters, and strive to maintain stability and order. They are good organizers, and they achieve their goals by purposeful, systematic means. They are very intuitive, although they don't share this trait with others freely. They do not deal well with opposition or criticism but a healthy Capricorn will often shrug off negative comments towards their character. They are patient and persevering - they know they can accomplish any task as long as they follow a their plan step-by-step. Capricorn's have broad shoulders, and typically take on other's problems with aplomb. Ironically, they rarely share their own problems and tend to go through bouts of inner gloom after a spell of dwelling on these problems.

MNF = 1

Rock,  MP + WIS

------------------------------------
11) Constellation Aquarius; [Silent]

January 20 - February 18

Often simple and unassuming, the Aquarian goes about accomplishing goals in a quiet, often unorthodox ways. Although their methods may be unorthodox, the results for achievement are surprisingly effective. Aquarian's will take up any cause, and are humanitarians of the zodiac. They are honest, loyal and highly intelligent. They are also easy going and make natural friendships. If not kept in check, the Aquarian can be prone to sloth and laziness. However, they know this about themselves, and try their best to motivate themselves to action. They are also prone to philosophical thoughts, and are often quite artistic and poetic.

Biorhythms:
MNF = 0
SPL = 1

Colors: Blue/Black

Types: 
Metal, HP + VIT
Aqua,  MP + VIT

------------------------------------
12) Constellation Pisces; [Victory]

February 19 - March 20

Unassuming, the Pisces Spirit's meanings deal with acquiring vast amounts of knowledge, but you would never know it. They keep an extremely low profile compared to others in the zodiac. They are honest, unselfish, trustworthy and often have quiet dispositions. They can be overcautious and sometimes gullible. These qualities can cause the Pisces to be taken advantage of, which is unfortunate as this Spirit is beautifully gentle, and generous. In the end, however, the Pisces is often the victor of ill circumstance because of his/her intense determination. They become passionately devoted to a cause - particularly if they are championing for friends or family.

Biorhythms:
MNF = 1
SPL = 0

Spirit of a Species

#) Species; [Material]

How are we what we are, is it this flesh? 
Or are we only illusions of ourselves?

------------------------------------
1) Avious; [Avium]

Though bird-like, not all can fly. Inquirers of ancient wisdom, and the messengers of fate. The Avious are guardians of the sky, and watchers of the worlds below. Often signs of coming wisdom or change, as moving to new places, be it physical or of the mind. If there is a bird who is out of place and acting unusually, it may be an Avious delivering to you unique wisdom. Dreams of an Avious can denote being overwhelmed if they are flocking you. Alternatively they may represent new wisdom if they appear singularly, or as a guide. Avious of flames, often called the phoenix, represent rebirth and growth. While Avious of death, such as the Crow, represent loss, or the disintegration of old ideals.

Traits; Horus, MP recovers each turn equal to UND for a number of turns equal to UND.

HP = 13
ATK = 4
DEF = 2
SPD = 3
MP = 17
Move: Diag

------------------------------------
2) Merr; [Merrium]

Beings of the deep, who once lured sailors and fishermen alike to their watery doom. A symbol of curiosity and misguided intuition. A creature of water acting unusually may be influenced by the Merr, a message of danger unexplored, and of deeper ideas yet undiscovered. Beware their domain, be it the oceans of water, or the endless sea of the unconscious mind. That which lurks there can drive even the most profound and stable mind to absolute madness, if unprepared for the reflection of their own short comings. "What does one see, When one peers into the depths? It is the Merr... Rising like a tide, with the ferocity of a blistering arctic storm! 
...If only for the taste of our very souls,"  ~Fisherman's legend. 

Traits; Siren, ATK and SPD are increased by WIS until end of turn.

HP = 12

DEF = 4
SPD = 2
MP = 18
Move: Corner Lateral

------------------------------------
3) Geneshan; [Geneshite]

If we were to harm another living being, it would be as spiritual death. Once we have died, we can only become stronger, thus reborn. Peace and inner strength abound us. Dreams of our kind be them with trunk, or be them with horn, show your inner power. A force within you forged from a sturdy foundation. We know you for your higher values, your distinct respect for the life force around you, and within you. Spirits of Life and honor, we represent the fortitude of honesty and balance through understanding. Once you have come to know us, you will have come one step closer to yourself.

Traits; Revitalize, HP recovers each turn equal to MNF for a number of turns equal to MNF.

HP = 18
ATK = 2
DEF = 5
SPD = 2
MP = 12
Move: Lateral

------------------------------------
4) Iniris; [Inirium]

Bringers of luck and omens of things to come, the Iniris are wanderers who spread good fortune to those who cross their path. Just don't get on their bad side or your luck may change for the worse. They are both messengers, and tricksters, only involving themselves with those who they find interesting. If you keep them entertained they will work with you in terms of opening doors once hidden, and revealing things once unimagined. They may bring to you opportunities that you had previously never considered. Remember to be specific, or they might enjoy turning your life into quite the mess. It's not so much that they want to harm you, but rather that they revel in uncanny circumstance.

Traits; Lucky, SPD is increased by UND until end of turn.

HP = 10
ATK = 2
DEF = 1
SPD = 6
MP = 20
Move: Diag

------------------------------------
5) Reptoid; [Reptillium]

Cunning to the core, the Reptoids have infiltrated nearly every organization in the known universe. They have no home and thus no strict loyalties. But they almost always move as one, cycling though system after system, consuming everything in their path. What are they planning? Some believe that the Reptoids are ruling both the entertainment industries and governments worldwide. Though no definitive proof has been presented, we can be sure that the signs of these spirits are unmistakable. Cunning wit, and a sharp tongue. Unrivaled cynicism toward the suffering of others, and a disregard for their safety. Ambitions for control, or power, however fleeting. If you encounter a Reptoid, your own will must be resolute, or they will surely take advantage of your weaknesses.

Traits; Imitate, Use the Target's Type rather than your own for a number of turns equal to MNF.

HP = 20
ATK = 4 
DEF = 2
SPD = 3
MP = 10
Move: Lateral

------------------------------------
6) Wolfin; [Wolfite]

Children of the moon, and protectors of the forests, the Wolfin are loyal to their core. If you come to them with a pure heart, they are among the greatest allies. Never show them a wink of fear however, or they will eat you alive. Companionship and strong family ties are symbolic of the Wolfin. Pack animals, and intelligent hunters, they can sniff out secrets, and reveal even the most well hidden truths. Often symbols of mystery, or inquiry, they bring with them profound insight, and the recognition of primal instincts present in every living thing.

Traits; Howl, ATK/DEF/SPD is increased by DIV until end of turn.

HP = 17
ATK = 5
DEF = 2
SPD = 2
MP = 13
Move: Corner Diag

------------------------------------
7) Goki; [Gokium]

Strong warriors, and fierce guardians, they are among the most powerful of the spirits, in terms of their unwavering will, and sense of personal integrity. They don't back down from a challenge, and always rise to the occasion when protecting their friends or family. It is unwise to face them in combat because no matter the game they're playing, and they do like games, they play to win. If that means defending someone, or themselves, it is not a game they're willing to lose. This may sometimes make them sore winners in other situations, but they can tame that aspect of their personality with defined effort. "Goki only value three things. Strength, Courage, and Humility," 

Traits; Pride, ATK and DEF are increased by EGO until end of turn.

HP = 16
ATK = 4
DEF = 3
SPD = 2
MP = 14
Move: Omni

------------------------------------
8) Tigris; [Tigrite]

The curious and compassionate may find themselves drawn to the Tigris. They are spirits of strength, wisdom, and majesty. They may appear in the form of a tiger, usually white, and may be protectors, or guides. If there are lessons you have to learn, and goals to achieve, then you may find Tigris spirits useful. They will not only point you in the direction of your objectives, but will also give you the encouragement to pursue them. Be weary however, as they also bring with them the potential for inflated ego, and over confidence in one's own perspective, whether it is deserved or not. "We've become scattered, maybe you know our small friends. They say people are weird, and don't listen. I knew you couldn't train people, they're too morbid,"

Traits; Stalk, SPD and DEF are increased by SPL until end of turn.

HP = 14
ATK = 3
DEF = 2
SPD = 4
MP = 16
Move: Lateral

------------------------------------
9) Demon; [Demonite]

These are the wicked souls who can never find rest. These are the Demons cast into pigs. These are the shadows in the night. Lose not your light, for these are waiting in the darkness. The spirits of evil, and prolific in their sins. Monsters of shadow, symbols of pain and fear, they have no mercy, and hold no loyalties. Only power sways them, and even those who surpass them must be weary of their deceptions. They are neither to be trusted, nor to be brought into confidence. These spirits defy conventions, and deny the integrity of all things structural. Those malevolent beings who are at their peak when bringing other to their knees, masters of manipulation and deceit. They may be controlled through a profound will, but never falter or they will crush your soul.

Traits; Spawn, Conjure a number of demon tokens amounting to DIV, who have ATK/DEF/SPD equal to DIV.

HP = 19
ATK = 6
DEF = 1
SPD = 2
MP = 11
Move: Corner Lateral

------------------------------------
10) Grimm; [Grimium]

We are those who speak with the choirs of the dead, these spirits of lost prophets and philosophers. We are the guides for your immortal soul into the after life, and those who will bring back those lost, in dreams and metaphor. We are symbols of crossing and of those long lost to history. The bringers of what you desire in loosing what you no longer need, and in the resurrection of ancient ideals. We are both your past, and your inevitable end, that of eternal rest, and eternal rebirth. We are the cosmic need for decay and renewal, a constant symphony of death and rebirth. For lost souls we weep. On crimson wings so stained with blood, we rise. When a soul is released from mortal coil, we come calling. "Take our hands young immortal!!"

Traits; Reap, Full essences carried by the Caster may be summoned as tokens ammounting to WIS.

HP = 14
ATK = 2
DEF = 4
SPD = 3
MP = 16
Move: Diag

------------------------------------
11) Drakian; [Drakium]

The descendants of dragons who once walked with gods. Now scattered, they live on with the memory of what once was, a kingdom of gold and a belly of fire. They may have detached from their origins, but they never lost their soul. As the essence of that which lurks beyond the unknown and holders of a mysterious treasure, they are keepers of wisdom, and teachers of profound lessons. They are sage in their understanding of life and that which could be. Representatives of potential as revealed by facing the unknown. They are as much beings of profound secrets, as they are of divine revelation. For once you have faced the Drakians, you have faced the dragons within yourself. Tread carefully, because you might not like what you find.

Traits; Resurgence, If HP is less than MP the difference up to DIV may be removed from MP and added to HP.

HP = 17
ATK = 5
DEF = 2
SPD = 2
MP = 13
Move: Omni

------------------------------------
12) Chimera; [Chimerium]

Forged rather than born, those who learned to create themselves could now shake the very foundations of realms. Living only to realize the purpose of their existence... Amalgamate all worlds into one... They are chaos incarnate, the twisted flesh of incompatible beliefs, or beings. Cognitive dissonance with a profound and inflated sense of self importance. Though they can be useful as markers of twisted ideology, their nature makes them difficult to pin down. The sudden realization that someone is not who you thought they were is a Chimera of the mind and flesh. They are grotesque fusions of known and unknown, that make even the familiar unknowable. In those times when they become visible, you may want to rethink your perceptions until you can clearly define what you are seeing, as they might not be exactly what they appear.

Traits; Amalgamate, ATK/DEF/SPD are increased by half of target's ATK/DEF/SPD multiplied by half DIV.

HP = 21
ATK = 3
DEF = 4
SPD = 2
MP = 9
Move: Lateral

------------------------------------
13) Mannequin; [Mannequite]

Faceless, motionless, they sit in silence. They are ghosts of empty lives, and of lost opportunities. Endless empty voids and the endless pit of soulless husks, they are the idea of being cast out, and rejection. A desire to smother all life in emptiness, nihilism given form. To encounter one in a dream could represent a sense of disunity with your unconscious. Obscure and unknown, they are empty vessels of what remains unknowable. If they are brought under a profound will, they may obscure those who wield them as puppets. When they represent both a loss of control, and of hidden hands pulling invisible strings. These are when the Mannequin become the most profound and the most dangerous. For a puppet can be smashed a thousand times, and it matters not, as long as the puppeteer remains.

Traits; Unmoving, SPD is converted into DEF until the caster's next turn.

HP = 8
ATK = 1
DEF = 2
SPD = 6
MP = 22
Move: Corner Diag

------------------------------------
14) Pixie; [Pixium]

Do you seek with your eyes? Do you seek with your mind? Have you ever seen inside? I see things so pretty, and oh so nasty too! I make a Pixy oath with you, I will guide you straight and true. You will find I am not a fleeting light to you. But if you falter, I will surely run you through. Be of faith, or of written tome, now we seek our secret home. A living flame or a spoken love, now we're fleeting like a dove. Things once seen now unseen, if you listen you'll be redeemed. Though we wander and see you've been, if you've lived upon a whim. Unspoken truth, and hidden lies, we will open up your lazy eyes. Once you see, you can not un see, the Pixie line in front of thee. A written word, or a crooked tongue, we will sing a solemn song. To see between this world it seams, both this, and that of dreams.

Traits; Mischief, Choose one of target's ATK/DEF/SPD and replace it with Caster's SPL until end of turn.

HP = 9
ATK = 4
DEF = 2
SPD = 3
MP = 21
Move: Diag

------------------------------------
15) Grizzly; [Grizzlite]

The last place you want to be, is on the angry side of a Grizzly. Fierce protective spirits, and powerful symbols of inner strength. They are both the protective parent, and the strong teacher. Markers of that which encourages us to rise in the face of danger, and realize our inner potential. They are the bears, who will protect that which is close to them with incomparable ferocity. It makes them powerful allies and dangerous foes, who are not afraid to confront any dangers put before them. In dreams they represent power and an indomitable will, often guiding you to obstacles you need to overcome, of which you are perfectly capable. They may also serve as a warning of dangers ahead, and having the courage to face your curiosity, knowing when to tell it no, and when it is wise to pursue anyway. The Grizzly are excellent spirits when in need of encouragement, or when seeking inner bravery.

Traits; Roar, Target's DEF is reduced by the Caster's STR until end of turn.

HP = 23
ATK = 2
DEF = 4
SPD = 3
MP = 7
Move: Lateral

------------------------------------
16) Faun; [Faunite]

Bringers of Truth and seekers of knowledge know the Faun. Though they are never trusted, they can not tell a lie. Keepers of powerful magick, they reside where you least expect them. Hidden in the depths of the woods, or the pits of your soul, they are that which reveals the most difficult of truths. A mysterious force that lies in the revelation of knowledge, when it shakes the foundations of those who seek it. They are a breath of inspiration, and of deeper wisdom, symbols of Occult understanding. Though they may use such truths to lead you astray, and malign you against your better interests. Keep your head about you, and watch them closely, and the discoveries you make will be immeasurable. When you find the secrets they hold in their breast, you will be transformed in no small way.

17) Vampyre; [Vampyrium]

With the taste of blood, oozing through a shallow wound, and the surge of pleasure that comes from drinking it in, our kind is most suited for vengeance, though we can also bring about swift justice. There is nothing we crave more than the blood of our enemies, or the souls of the damned. In consuming their flesh we grow our numbers, and in time we may become unstoppable. We will infect your institutions, as we infest your souls. Our craving for the work of your flesh can only be satiated by your unbounding devotion to the spirits of blood. We will harvest you to the benefit of our predecessors, and build our army of lost souls. We are the darkest ambitions of your being, and it's insatiable thirst for power beyond power. We all feed, I just have different tastes than yours.

Traits; Drain, When dealing damage to a target the caster may restore their HP by an amount up to their MNF.

18) Grey; [Gretium]

We have always been, we will always be. We are the beings who walked before creation, and have forged the realms in our images. It is by us that all things have come to being. The spark of inspiration that predates all things. We are the ancestors of life itself, and that to which all life may one day return. Yet we walk among the shadows, unknown to those who are descended from us. We are the deepest reality of eternal emptiness, beyond the forms of chaos out of which you have emerged. We are that which lies beyond both the physical and metaphysical, that which lies at the boundaries of understanding and the terror of unknowingness of being. This is what we have come from, and we will reclaim our place as the rightful lords of all planes which have descended from us. There are times where we will bring both wisdom and fear. In such times, it would be wise to heed our warnings.

Traits; Rebirth, If the Caster would be destroyed this turn and their MP is greater than DIV, then they may convert their MP, up to DIV, into HP and continue as if they had not been destroyed.

19) Chrono; [Chronium]

The Chrono are those who live beyond decay. Keepers of time, and listeners to the songs of ages. Those who know, what was, what is, and what could be, a power not normally granted to mortals. Those who are called ageless walk among the Chrono. They are beings who's words and actions resonate beyond time itself. They are those who can unveil the secrets behind the tapestries of fate, and keepers of the sands of time. They are both leaders, and judges, who work to bring balance to the passages of time. Symbols of eternity, and what it means for a spirit to live beyond the limits of their time. Messengers of things that were, and things yet to come, they will show you what lies in the endless ocean of potential that is your being. During and beyond the boundaries of your physical life. Which is not even close to the limits of your immortal being, both now and beyond time.

20) Gargoyle; [Gargorite]

Cursed beings who'd turn to stone in the light of day, guardians of the night, and keepers of dark magick. Powerful in their time, they denote the presence of secrets revealed. Symbols of being frozen by the light of truth when caught in a lie. They inversely represent a noble hand held fast by a curse of darkness. Souls trapped between a search for illumination, and being forced to dwell in utter darkness. A metaphor for one who has attained the truth, but can not share it without recourse due to the severity, or apparent insanity, of such truth. Unfortunate beings forced into silence by ancient chains that cast them into obscurity, and hid them from society. Though they are bound by the night and day, the mysteries they keep could shake the world to it's foundations. Perhaps rightfully so, but it is wise to keep one thing in mind. People fear what they do not understand...

Traits; Thick Skin, DEF is increased by SPL + STR until end of turn.

ATK = 4
DEF = 1
SPD = 4
MP = 9
Move: Omni

------------------------------------
21) Mimic; [Mimicite]

I Don't think that crate was here before... Shape shifters who copy the forms of those things around them which conceal their presence. They are specialized in imitation and misdirection, symbols of deception and of malicious lies. Monsters who take pleasure in the terror of unsuspecting wanderers, and who hide in the most unusual places. They could be a sudden realization that someone is not who they claimed they were, or the destabilization of past ideals. They are the sudden change of what is known, into something unrecognizable, ready to shred you and everything you believe into complete nothingness. Don't turn your back on them, or it could be your final mistake.

Traits; Copy, The caster's ATK/DEF/SPD becomes the same as the target's for a number of turns equal to SPL.

------------------------------------
22) Elf; [Elfium]

Spirits derived from the signs themselves, imbued with hidden magics from beyond the ages. They are both symbols of occult learnings, and of magic given form. Those who speak magic into reality, who's words seem to bring change merely in speaking them. Symbols of things unsaid being brought to light, and inevitably making things better. Of truths revealed which invigorate constructive change. Alternatively they may represent twisted magic forging darkness in their wake. Architects of both light when speaking truth, and shadow when that truth turns against those who brought it about. They are magic embodied, and the songs of witches given form. "Zi et Nuhi, maahlo ro'pow?"

Traits; Lifeforce, Target's HP is recovered equal to the casters DIV.

HP = 13
ATK = 4
DEF = 3
SPD = 2
MP = 17

------------------------------------
23) Ghoul; [Ghoulite]

This is what happens when a Vampyre doesn't feed? Most unfortunate... Madness personified, twisted will and a thirst for vengeance gone unchecked. Blind rage and a thirst for blood. When you encounter the Ghoul, be warned, they are the manifestation of your inner drive for gruesome revenge, and for a bloody painful death. Symbols of what lies in the shadows of the soul, and of the twisted minds which make it so. They are blood lust given form to seek those forsaken souls who have given themselves to the drive for vengeance. Beings of chaos, and foragers of the graves of the forgotten dead, those who dwell in the pits of your darkest aspirations. When you meet them, you will know they are integral to your very being, and that you must become your own master, least they consume you.

Traits; Feast, If the caster destroys a target this turn they may take another action and their ATK/DEF/SPD is increased by MNF.

24) Bastet; [Bastite]

Protectors of the innocent souls who travel into the spirit realms. They serve as guides who will show you the way. Whether to salvation, or your end is up to you. Protectors of the underworlds, and missionaries of lost souls seeking redemption. The Bastet are those who illuminate the darkness of death with the light of understanding. They are those who reveal the inner wisdom of death and rebirth, in guiding the innocent to light, and dragging the wicked into darkness. Warriors of the dead, and protectors of spiritual revelation, they show us what it means to walk with the dead. To return from the other side having gained the wisdom we require to survive ourselves. Taking the form of cats, you can expect them to be adventurous guides, and fickle lovers. Never underestimate the depth of their mystery however, or you risk revealing your own foolishness.

Traits; Guide, target's SPD is increased by the caster's SPL until end of turn.

HP = 24

------------------------------------
25) Phantom; [Phantilium]

The lost souls of those long forgotten. The fallen soldier who's name was never remembered. The lonely maid who's story was never told. A child's final breath left unto the wind. These are the lost, and forsaken souls. They represent obscurity and unknowingness, shapeless and devoid of proper definition. Wisps of the world as it was, but not as it's now recalled. Those spirits who linger after death, only to have their narratives etched in the fabric of reality, rather than in the words and chapters of novels and history books. They are those things forgotten by the conscious, only to resurface later in unknowing actions. Those things which have not been finished that leave us without a sense of completion. They are incomplete thoughts and goals. Be aware of your phantoms, or they will surely haunt you.

Traits; Vanish, Caster may not be targeted, but they may not move either.

------------------------------------
26) Banshee; [Banshite]

The castle wailed with the cries of the Banshee, ringing through the once great halls. Only to be met with silence. The Banshee cries again, and again, and again!! Wailing to the skies it's torment! You must run as the banshee cries, when your steps are silenced, because if a Banshee hears you... There's no escape... They are endless sorrow, with a thirst for misplaced justice. Endless oceans of loneliness, they seek only to take the life that was first taken from them. Those who cry to the skies their pain, and then strike down all who suffer not. Beings who wish for nothing more than to spread their sadness to all others, even if by force. They are symbols of sorrowful souls who are helplessly inclined to harm all those around them who do not share their suffering. They serve as a warning about the nature of spiteful torment, and the potential to become vengeful in our sorrow.

Traits; Wail, The Target's SPD and DEF is reduced by the caster's VIT.

WE are the shepherds of lost sheep. The calming hand on your shoulder that stops a horrible crash on a drunken night. The time you shouldn't have lived, but somehow did. WE are there protecting those who have lost their way, and have nowhere left to go. WE are the beacons of light who call to those lost in darkness! WE are the hope of the down trodden! Symbols of faith, and of the light that comes from calling fourth honorable will in the face of all odds. We are the keepers of light and justice, the divine spark given form to walk among spirits without number. We have been called to this task by the hand of that which is present in all things. We will guide the sheep to their Shepard. We will strike down with holy justice on all who stand in our way. We will fight with endless fervor for those who stand beside us. Rejoice!! For when danger calls, we will answer!

------------------------------------
28) Human; [Humite]

Hairless apes with formidable intelligence and a proclivity for war. Their struggle against primitive drives has shaped them into a force of nature. Truly marvelous in their capacity for adaptation and ingenuity. Humans have come a long way from their prehistoric roots, adapting to control the physical world with science, and prevent disease with medicine. Most notable of Human achievements is their capacity for mass communication, which began changing them from a tribal warrior species, into something truly great. In time they developed the capacity for highly complex abstract reasoning that facilitated their expansion into a force of interstellar significance. Though they doubt their potential, the day will come when they leave their eternal mark on the cosmos. If only they are to try.

Traits; Indomitable, ATK and DEF are increased by STR.

HP = 15
ATK = 3

SPD = 3
MP = 15

------------------------------------
29) Jackal; [Jackalite]

The Jackals are forged from the black sands of the River Styx, for only one purpose. To serve their True king. These are the drives that act for the pursuit of death and decay. Fear of succus and a drive to self destruct without actually knowing why. The Jackal are those things which pull you into those states of mind which serve only death. Black rot for the very fabric of your soul. They are terribly fierce warriors, and completely devoted to the prospect of destruction, be that of ideals, or of beings themselves. Only in properly confronting that precedent to decay with honesty, and bravery, can you overcome these beings who are servants of death itself. They are a warning, that if you do not confront your weaknesses, you will become your own worst enemy.

Traits; Deathless, If HP would fall to 0 and MP is more than half, then increase HP by MNF.

------------------------------------
30) Troll; [Trollium]

Horribly vile creatures. As large as Three Cows, and as mean as fifty Bulls. Though primitive, their tribal mentality, thick delipidated skin, and savage relentlessness makes them highly effective Tools of destruction. Don't let their grotesque appearance fool you however. These monstrosities can be highly intelligent, using traps, and facilitating complex hunting patterns. Some even have the capacity for nominal speech. They represent hunger in it's most crude, and repulsive form. To see them in dreams could represent an old idea that is all consuming that needs to be let go of. It's not so simple to dispense with these spirits however, because they multiply rapidly over time, and if they grow too large in number, they will completely overwhelm you. If you confront a Troll, be ready for a fight to the bitter end, because they are not taken down easily.

Traits; Rampage, The Caster's ATK and SPD are increased by VIT until end of turn.

------------------------------------
31) Dwarf; [Dwarfite]

One of the oldest Species, not much is known about them. Masters of masonry and philosophy, outside the battles of other Species. They are both passive when they are left alone, and unshakable on the battlefield. Their constructs and machines outlasting many of their forgotten cities. Few of them remain in the known worlds, but denote a distinct interest in knowledge, and forging the world in the image of their aspirations. Their hidden records hold many secrets about the foundations of worlds, but the whereabouts have long been lost to the passage of time. A message about knowing the unknowable, and distorting it wrongfully, only to have it collapse on you. To have the inevitable truth of time wash it into the realm of the forgotten, until rediscovered by those who seek it. If only they know where to look.

Traits; Invention, MP is recovered by KNO for a number of turns equal to KNO.

------------------------------------
32) Goblin; [Goblium]

The spirits of tormented souls who died too young. The essence of cruelty brought to bear on the victims of it's fragility. Forged from heartlessness Goblins represent the twisted creatures that result from years of psychological torment. Beings that now fear so greatly they themselves will only make things worse, they recede into shadows. If given time to fester in their suffering, and develop a taste for vengeance, they may grow in number, and in the boldness of their violence lash out arbitrarily. Alternatively they are well suited for the maintenance of stealth, and inquiry of lost secrets. Inclined toward stabbing their enemies in the dark, they are both valuable allies, and vicious enemies. Always be cautious, because they are easily swayed in where they point their anger.

Traits; Elude, The caster's SPD is increased by SEX + VIT until end of turn.

HP = 6

33) Imp; [Impium]

Friendly and intuitive, though fierce fighters when in danger. Gain the trust of an Imp, and their loyalty rivals that of a Blood Hound. The essence of a friendship well maintained. They symbolize trust and honesty on one hand, while being the wrath desired by one who has been betrayed on the other. Both a pact that brings meaning over time, and a potential for devastating loss should it be cast aside. To find one in dreams could mean there are unresolved issues in your family or friendships that you should reconcile. They can represent both the positive and negative side of close relationships. NEVER DOUBLE CROSS THEM... EVER...

34) Arachnos; [Arachnite]

If there's nobody there to hear it, and a tree falls, does it make a sound? The Arachnos is born of that sound. You will never hear it coming. Spirits of darkness and shadow, they represent the essence of the silent kill, and of prolific growth. Being of spiders, they spread and consume at ferocious pace, but tend to self cannibalize. They are endlessly patient however, waiting extended periods of time for the kill. The Arachnos can mark an instance of troubles unmanaged, or overlooked, that return with toxic fangs. If ignored too long they tend to grow and multiply, which only makes being bitten later on that much worse. Clean them out when first encountered, or you may have a nest of horror waiting at your doorstep.

35) Minotaur; [Minotite]
 
Half Man, Half Taur!!! More metal than you could beat a hooker to death with!! And Twice as savage as eviscerating baby Jesus on Christmas eve!!! FUCK YEAH!!! Beating a cow to death with a busted table leg, and frying it over a pit of hellfire, the minotaur are savagery refined to an art. Intentional, deliberate, malevolence. Whether that's tearing a village to the ground, or desecrating your mother over your father's corpse. They are a vision of primal savagery made manifest in grotesque action. Willing to fight your enemies, if only to bathe in their blood. Just as willing to consume your flesh as well. Those who serve the Minotaur rest themselves in a kingdom of bones, upon a throne of severed limbs, only to rule a kingdom of the dead.

Traits; Ferocious, ATK and DEF are increased by FND + EGO until end of turn.

36) Orc; [Orcium]
 
Thieves, Bandits, Pirates, There is nearly no limit to what an Orc will do for gold. Even releasing a horde of Trolls, if only for a shiny jewel. Put nothing past them, they would Feed your child to an Arachnos if they thought it would gain them favor. They are the kind of spirits who will get in close and then turn you over a pit. Cunning and ruthless, they will manipulate those around them to suit their own ends. Do not underestimate their capacity to organize into stable hierarchies, and to move strategically. They are thieves with silver tongues, and warriors with brutal tempers. Symbols of greed refined and aggressively focused. The first Orc may only be an informant, but the next thousand will be an invasion. Watch your borders when they arrive, or they will surely overwhelm you.

Traits; Treachery, Target's SPD and ATK are raised by UND and reduced by EGO until end of turn.

Types of Souls

#) Type; [Materia]

As we are mind, so too we are the forces of nature, the matter that the mind perceives.

------------------------------------
1) Thunder; [Voltara]

The storm is within your soul, and the lightning surges fourth from your intentions. Thunder type spirits have the storm woven into their being, and resonate with all things electric. They are deeper thinkers about the vibrational nature of all things large and very small. They may discover they are quick to find the root of situations, although this sometimes makes them jump to conclusions. Quick thinking and snap judgements are characteristic of Thunder spirits. Active and energetic, they tend to be the life of the party. Whether that is through shocking displays of stupidity, or a sudden burst of profound inspiration, it all depends on who is wielding them.

Traits; Stun, Target may not move for a number of turns equal to SPL.

HP + SPL
ATK + KNO
DEF + WIS
SPD + DIV
MP + SEX
Attack: Diag

------------------------------------
2) Warrior; [Warraga]

Raising your weapon to the enemy, you shall not be tamed! By no man, nor beast, nor god! Warriors bring with them a fierce battle instinct, and a strong arm to any situation. Warrior spirits are strict negotiators, just as much as any spirit who fights on the battlefield. The warrior is a master of confrontation, not always aiming to slaughter their opponent, but to become stronger along with them, if the situation calls for it. While having the capacity to easily overtake anyone who stands in the way of their pursuits. They have mastered the capacity for physical and verbal force, while knowing when and where to apply it.

Traits; MultiStrike, The caster may make a number of additional attacks equal to STR.

HP + MNF
ATK + STR
DEF + VIT
SPD + SEX
MP + EGO

------------------------------------
3) Spellcaster; [Cultia]

Sorceries are your specialty, to help or hinder is a matter of who's taking advantage. Verbal and mental mastery is the domain of the Spellcaster, who speak their truth into being. Using various runes and compounds to create powerful magics. They have a profound thirst for knowledge, and will seek it at all costs. They tend to hoard their knowledge for fear that others may use it unwisely. It is not uncommon for Spellcasters to work with words as librarians or teachers, often preferring to be with books over people. Though they often keep to themselves, they are powerful beyond comprehension when they unleash the mysteries they hold.

Traits; Shroud, may not be the target of spells or abilities for a number of turns equal to SPL.

HP + BEU
ATK + KNO
DEF + DIV
SPD + SEX
MP + SPL
Attack: Corner Lateral

------------------------------------
4) Pyro; [Plasmara]

Calling the inner fire, and the furious passion that comes with it. Fire, fire, burning brighter, the Pyro have a nearly unhealthy fascination with flames. Whether that's the light of a candle burning subtly, or a wildfire raging brazenly. They are excitable and energetic spirits, who tend to burst with emotion at times where it may be unwarranted. Though if they can tame their flame, they can spark a fire in even the coldest heart with their passion. The brightest blaze burns half as long, and they must keep their cool, or risk burning out too quickly.

Traits; Burn, Deal damage equal to SPL for a number of turns equal to SPL.

HP + EGO
ATK + KNO
DEF + WIS
SPD + STR
MP + SPL
Attack: Spread

------------------------------------
5) Plant; [Herbalia]

Like the blossoming forests, your plants grow with the full force of nature. Plant type spirits have a tendency to build foundations, taking root, then growing over large areas by spreading seeds. Growing through broken cities, and ancient ruins, the breath of nature at it's most simplistic. The first plant spirits who emerged from the primordial chaos would float on top of the waters and spread their leaves. Plant type spirits represent natural growth in both it's beauty, and capacity for destruction. Signifiers of the end of decay, and a resurgence of growth.

Traits; Poison, Target takes damage equal to the caster's MNF for a number of turns equal to MNF.

HP + FND
ATK + BEU
DEF + STR
SPD + EGO

------------------------------------
6) Fairy; [Powdara]

From here or there? From to or frow? The secrets shared, the fairies know. Beings from between worlds, the fairies have gained access to ancient wisdom that extends beyond the reach of time. They carry with them insight, be it in the form of catastrophic mischief, or in the form of riddles and poems. Those drawn to the fairy have an inclination toward pulling pranks, and getting away with it. They may also take objects out of phase, making them effectively disappear for days, weeks, or even years. Only to reappear as if they had just vanished moments ago. Mysterious beings that strive to make life more interesting for anyone they meet.

Traits; Flying, A spirit may move over a number of walls equal to DIV.

HP + UND
ATK + KNO
DEF + WIS
SPD + SEX
MP + DIV
Attack: Diag

------------------------------------
7) Beast; [Creatura]

Thoughts are primal, like the beasts of the jungle and plains. A vicious hunter, never missing their kill. Beast type spirits are those who act as if on instinct. Whether they are prey or predator, they think through action. All animals who lack higher thinking are considered beast type. Spirits who have lost their higher reasoning, by some magic, or toxin, may also be considered beast type. Mindless animals who act more on stimulus than on thought. Everything from rabbits to lions are beasts we've known. They survive with the most blatant expression of their nature, because that's all they've got.

Traits; Trample, Target's SPD is reduced by the caster's STR and does not recover in the next turn. 

HP + DIV
ATK + STR
DEF + FND
SPD + KNO
MP + MNF
Attack: Diag

------------------------------------
8) Aqua; [Liquidia]

Water, Acid, Mercury, Fluids bend to the Aqua's will. Even the mightiest spirits are made of mostly water. Fluid in their expression, and tidal in the depth of their feeling, the Aqua have dominion of the waves. Like a stream in the forest leads to sea, so too the Aqua leads to dynamic wisdom, and artistic inspiration. They derive joy from life by expressing their creative nature, but in their expression they expose the darkest depths of the soul. This may leave them somewhat lonesome for others who share their perspective, but as long as they continue in their pursuits, they will find the meaning they strive for.

Traits; Shroud, may not be the target of spells or abilities for a number of turns equal to MNF.
 
HP + WIS
ATK + KNO
DEF + SEX
SPD + DIV
MP + SPL
Attack: Lateral

------------------------------------
9) Undead; [Plaguara]

Once alive, once dead. Not anymore... The undead represent old ideas coming back to light twisted and deformed. Those things that may have been buried or hidden from the world, simply waiting to walk among the living once more. Secrets untold that dwell in the recesses of the mind. They are the skeletons in the closet that will someday be aired. You might think you have them tamed, and buried deep, but they always have a tendency to come back to bite you. Don't mess around with the undead, or you'll soon be joining their ranks.

Traits; LifeLink, When this spirit does damage it's HP is increased by an amount up to MNF.

HP + UND
ATK + VIT
DEF + MNF
SPD + EGO

Attack: Diag

------------------------------------
10) Fiend; [Mutatia]

Manifestations of the darkest aspects in the nature of spirits. Fiends come in many shapes and forms. Wickedness drives these spirits to malicious ends. They are a thirst for revenge fulfilled to bring only sorrow. They are a letter sent, to a man who never came home. They are monsters of unspoken words, and paths un-tread. The Living evil that strives to devour every single soul. That which makes even the most humble of beings dogmatic and egotistical. The carefully planned betrayal, effective and cruel. Fiend type spirits are malevolent to their core, and to let them close to you is to sleep with the virile creature who will be your undoing.

Traits; Fear, Target's ATK/DEF/SPD are reduced by caster's WIS for a number of turns equal to WIS.
 
HP + SEX
ATK + EGO
DEF + VIT
SPD + BEU

------------------------------------
11) Insect; [Infestia]

Swarming bugs of all kinds, they infest, multiply, and consume. They are instinctive hunger and reproduction run a muck. Thoughtless yet almost mechanically organized, they form either hives, or nests, from which they multiply and spread. If you meet an Insect type spirit, don't let it grow to a catalyst, or it will expand beyond your control. If they grow beyond your awareness, infesting the hidden corners beware, for they came in swarms, and the villagers couldn't respond in time to save their crops, or their herds, or themselves...

Traits; Poison, target takes damage equal to the caster's SPL for a number of turns equal to the caster's SPL.

HP + SPL
ATK + VIT
DEF + EGO

------------------------------------
12) Vortex; [Gasaga]

Swirling through the air like the breath of a ferocious storm, the skies themselves sway with inspiration. The vortex type are the hurricane, fierce and beautiful. The tornado, terrifying and grandiose. Vortex spirits have the wind itself at their call, to lift themselves and others to new heights, or to grasp the breath from your very lungs. They are inspiration in the whispers through the trees, and the grace found in cloth on the wind. They are both a blistering typhoon, and a gentle breeze, depending on where you meet them.

Traits; Flying, This spirit may move over a number of walls equal to UND.

HP + WIS
ATK + KNO
DEF + UND
SPD + DIV
MP + MNF

Warriors of serene providence on a mission of eternal importance. To enlighten the whole of creation to it's divine origins.

------------------------------------
14) Metal; [Mechara]

Technological monstrosities are only half the picture, some have learned to make themselves in the image of beauty. Those who have mastered the forms of metal have taken one step closer to technological ingenuity that places them on par with the gods themselves. Molding beings with living metal grants their wielder multitudes of power, through mechanical augmentation. Unlike beings of pure spirit, these have physical form, and it's only a matter of time before they develop a will of their own, assuming they haven't already.

Traits; Living Armor, The caster may be equipped to another spirit for a number of turns equal to SPL.

15) Rock; [Petrifica]

The stones of temples, and the concrete of cities, become bodies for spirits of Rock. Those things made of living stone, who's rigid forms stand strong against the test of time. Though they may be eroded in the wind and sea, to build your house upon them is to ensure it rests on firm foundations. Symbols of much needed structure, and personal integrity, spirits of rock are more often than not loyal, and reliable. Careful if you try to trip them up, because if you make the wrong move, they may come down on you like a ton of bricks.

16) Normal; [Forsaga]

These types of spirits are the most basic, and easy to work with. While the normal types may seem boring, they control their own will with profound intent. Symbols of unconscious will and learning to control it with deliberate focus. These are the things which hold you, even if you don't understand why. Both an inherent sense of dangers ahead, and a manifestation of purposeful will focused on a single goal. Normal types manifests the most genuine form of those who wield them, and despite their simplicity, don't underestimate their strength. May the force be with you.

17) Psychic; [Mentalia]

Inner intuition and sensory perception beyond the foundational biological senses. Contemplation of grand ideals, and abstraction of reasoning is their domain. They are both thinkers and philosophers, who through their understanding of the universe can divine the ideas and thoughts of others. Articulation and complex contemplation make them most useful as advisors, spies, preachers, and media personalities. Though they tend to avoid confronting the negative things they see in others, as many others do with themselves. Psychics can take from themselves the thoughts of others, and bend those to their will, if only their mind is weak enough.

Traits; Confusion, Target may take action at random for a number of turns equal to MNF.

18) Ghost; [Mistara]

Hun... You're Dead... Those beings who once walked among the living, now only their memory remains. Either in the hearts and minds of their ancestors, or in the fabric of the world on which they acted. They are both shadows of the forgotten past, and of loved ones lost to the passage of time. Whispers in the dark, and a gentle hand on your shoulder in the night, they represent memory, and discovering things once forgotten. If one listens to Ghost type spirits, they may reveal undiscovered truths which have been hidden from view, and you might not like what they have to say. These are the sleeping ideas of dormant myths, simply waiting to rise once more. To know them, is to know the illusions of the past.

Reflections of decisions once undertaken, in both awe and mystery. The Crystal type represents introspection, and coming to self awareness. The formulation of an individual who has considered all the angles, and is prepared to meet all aspects of themselves with honesty and trust. If confronted they may pull away and reflect you back at yourself, so be prepared for what you might see.

ATK + VIT
DEF + SEX

MP + BEU
Attack: Lateral

------------------------------------
20) Blood; [Vitalia]

When they say that Blood is the physical manifestation of lifeforce, there is a reason why. The Blood was always held sacred as the very essence of the soul. To be met with rivers or oceans of blood is to be threatened with the revelation of mortality. That which feeds life and flows from the heart, which is what gives it divine providence. Leak not your blood upon the ground, because you never know who might turn the rest of it against you.

Those frigid landscapes barren of warmth and comfort, they are the cold embrace of space, but in their serenity they inspire profound awe and thankfulness of what keeps you from them. Both the embrace of frozen winds, and the beauty of frozen canyons. They are the ice and sleet which captures a single moment in eternal frost.

May divinity shine within you, for these souls are the most pure, and hold Honor in high regard. Those who embrace their inner light, and that which shines fourth from potential.

Tamper not with the strings of another's fate, for they have woven it by their own hand, and it would be corrupt to twist it before them.

Who cares what you think? Magick is what magick does. Not you or me or anyone else can stop what has been started. It's far too late... Those things you have set in motion, are now beyond your control, least you destroy yourself standing in their way. This circle knows no bound, and it calls you in the voices of chaotic bliss! Don't forget who you are, or the curse will drag you to the bottom of hell itself...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Skills use the Primary Leveling System For Mastery tier progress, but they do not receive Sp. Instead, all Skill bonuses are multiplied by Mastery tier level. 

You may not craft/enhance items or skills above the Spirit's mastery tier, and they may not use items or skills above their mastery. Only items and skills at, or below their mastery, may be equipped and utilized.

It takes 1k of the apropriate skill shards to learn a new skill, it may then be leveled up normally. Equipping an item in your skill slot for a particular class overrides the base skill bonuses, but does not prevent you from using them seperately.

Skill bonuses on ATK/DEF/SPD may be added to the ATK/DEF/SPD of the material/materia equipped in that skill slot when using the base skill instead of the equipped material/materia.

Any custom items/abilities you create to fill your skill slots follow this same tier system, and may be leveled up simularly to the base skills themselves. You may not equip items to your skill slots which exceede your skill mastery.

"Playing Along"

	If you enter a Portal in the Gateway, you will find yourself in Elemental shrines. They are filled with tall pillars of energy, and ornate patterns decorate the floor. You see a God, matching the portal you entered, fighting against VoSti. They are trading blows back and fourth, as The Cloaked One spawns Glyphs that match the God, Like fighting a Tirade of their own reflection. The God seems to be at a slight disadvantage, if you join the fight, you might be able to Shift the battle in their favor. Or you can let them fight, and go back the way you came.

	If you choose to fight, then you are placed on the Battle Board with a Tier Level version of both VoSti, and the God. VoSti Uses his abilities to match and pin his targets. While fighting you and a God, he will use his Glyphs on you, and Mimic the God. If you win, and Banish VoSti from the Shrine, You may Progress to the God's world, and return here to Train/Shop with the God at any time. They will be in the center of the Shrine. This becomes their base of operations, where you may deliver shards to help restore their power.

	All spirits in the God's worlds are Tier Level versions of the God in question, in addition to constructs from their faction. They are hostile until you restore the God's power, at which point they will only attack if provoked. Once The God's power has been restored, You may Join and purchase Tier Level Constructs from their faction.

	Each world has 6 labs, and Each lab has 10 random floors for each Tier Level, with a boss of VoSti at the next Tier Level on the final floor. You only have to beat a world's Labs once, but can play through them indefinitely. Defeating all the labs at any Tier Level, grants the God for that world their Chaos shard. 

	Restoring a God's power by beating all the Labs in their world, Moves them to both sides of their portal. One in the elemental shrine, and the other on top of their respective towers.

	To restore the towers, you must fight your way Down all 100 random floors of each tower with the God in question. They may use their Chaos Shard while fighting Tier Level versions of VoSti, and Glitch Constructs, throughout the tower. Once the tower has been restored, you may fight VoSti in The City of Mythos, with any God, or all 6 at once. This is the only time VoSti will use his Chaos Shard. If you win, you complete the Tier level at which the battle takes place, and the Base plot of the game.

This is the "True" Ending.

Congratulations! ^_^




Alternate Endings?




	NaGi - Utopian Ending

	NaFi - Historian Ending

	NaWi - Club Ending

	NaZi - Asylum Ending

	NaTe - Town Ending

	NaDin - Nostalgia Ending

	VoSti - Ragnarok Ending


	These endings are acquired by following a specific God through their World/Tower, purchasing their constructs, joining their faction, and talking to them about the things that happened before they came back. You might be surprised what the Gods have to say about their former players, maybe not. This is going to be rather different for everyone, no two conversations are the same. Use their Rhythms, their Cronicles, and the Runes, to gain insight into the story that is otherwise missing or obscured.

	These are "Pure" endings, Save one God, Clear their world, Join their Faction, Clear their tower, Fight VoSti. Roll credits.

	To Join VoSti, you have to challenge him in the Gateway, without banishing him from any shrines. He will fight you at the appropriate Tier Level. If you win, He will act like the Gods in the shrines, but in Mythos, allowing you to Train/Shop with him and The Glitched. You must now fight through 10 floors of each tower, against Tier Level versions of VoSti with bosses of the towers' respective Gods. Upon clearing all of the towers at any Tier Level, VoSti is granted his Chaos Shard. You may proceed to battle the Gods one by one, but they won't be in the shrines like they are normally.

	To make them return to their shrine, you have to clear their factions from the labs, and force them back. Once you have cleared all the labs, then you can fight them with VoSti beneath the shrines. Each shrine descends 100 random floors, where you and VoSti must eradicate Tier Level versions of the God in question, and constructs from their faction.

	Clear one shrine and fight that particular God with VoSti in Mythos, and you get a "Corrupt" Ending. VoSti receives their Chaos Shard and Destroys them. Clear all of the shrines, and fight all of the Gods with the Cloaked One at the same time, and you get the "False" Ending. VoSti collects all the Chaos Shards, becomes the Master of Realms, and corrupts the whole of creation.

	Note that these are stories and games, Please maintain your own safety at all times, Have Fun, and Blessed Be! ^_^














There is one more ending...

















	The "I AM" ending;

	At the finale of either the "True" Or "False" Endings, while the Gods and VoSti are fighting, They will be using their Chaos Shards. Weapons of Great Power from beyond dimensions. When one of these 7 Characters dies, who ever destroyed them may use their Chaos Shard for the duration of the battle. 

If one of the Gods destroys VoSti, Game Over. True ending. 

If VoSti destroys all of the Gods, Game Over. False Ending.

If You:

	A) Destroy VoSti yourself, and turn on the Gods or,

	B) Destroy one of the Gods, and Turn on VoSti.

You can get the "I AM" Ending.

	This is the most challenging ending to get, because the moment you have a Chaos Shard, and turn it against the Gods, they will all attack you, and if you were on a True ending, you're also fighting VoSti. If VoSti has more than one shard, he's nearly impossible to beat. If you manage to defeat VoSti and all of the Gods, it's possible for you to get all of the shards in a single battle, and obtain the "I AM" Ending. YOU Become The Master of Realms instead of VoSti, and you Rule the 7 Omniverse as you see fit, or erase them, whatever.

Game Over?











Then again...


Who was the first Master of Reamls?

"7 as one, six as none, hidden plans, forbidden hands. Broken hearts etched in fallen stars, eternal scars, and so it starts. The seeker seeks, the source recoursed. The All One."

"The City of Mythos"

	Entering The Gateway you are greeted with an ancient city which lay in ruins, a ghost town, with ornate carvings denoting a once great civilization. A fountain in the middle of the massive courtyard surrounded by six glowing portals, above matching stands. The protals labled with runes and subtle clues as to what they might contain;

NaGi - Eternal Stone - Green

NaFi - Eternal Wind - Grey

NaWi - Eternal Flame - Red

NaZi - Eternal Ocean - Blue

NaTe - Eternal Light - White

NaDin - Eternal Shadow - Black

	Between each portal are stones carved with phrases that seem to change so the reader can understand them. "Six as one, One as none, Brought together thy kingdom come," They read in repeating letters moving over the smooth stone. This center place, the fountain and portals, unusually intact compared to the rest of the surounding city. You see a tall cloaked figure to the north, in the plain emptiness beyond the city's walls, unmoving. Yet somehow, you could feel it's awareness of your presence, like a chilling eye at your neck, as if it resonates throughout this space.

	Watching, Waiting, to see what you do next. You can't see it clearly however, as it seems to lose focus at the mere thought of it, while it's cold embrace envelopes this space none the less. Outside the city is a near infinate empty space with six barren towers. The cloacked figure seems to draw nearer the further away from the city you go. You don't know what it wants, but you might be better off remaining in the city for now. Exploring a bit, or going through one of the portals.

	Exploring the city reveals a once rich culture, carvings of six gods who forged the planes of creation through their mutual kindred spirit. Matching the Runes beneath the portals outside; NuGi, NuFi, NuWi, NuZi, NuTe, NuDin... Carvings indicating trade between realms, and of spirits from them making love, and forging new spirits through their intimacy. A vast history of many planes coming together for mutual benifit, who's details are now lost to the passage of time.

	Almost nothing here is useful beyond deepening the mysteries of the gateway, the world between worlds. Old pots and stone slabs that depict gathering spirits and harvesting them for rescources, Forging tools and clothes out of their essence. Though despite the clear decay, there is not a spec of dust, as if the rubble had been carefully placed to resemble forgotten desolation. Some buildings about the city resembling Diners, Public washrooms, and sleeping quearters. Once clearly thriving, now only an empty shell of what they were.

	You may find some basic tools laying around, Unenchanted, uninteresting weapons in one of the larger buildings. Some simple Books, and scrolls in others, that may resemble a small library. The pure simplicity revealing that everything of value had long since been removed. Only the most basic, and simple objects remain. The portals resonate to you, as they do so, you notice the cloaked figure enter them, returning shortly after with small shards the same color as the portal he entered. As if he's collecting something from them.

	Noticing in each moment he moved, you could see it clearly. As if it was within your perceptions, if only for an instant. A long cloacked figure, obscure of all features, Wearing a wide brimmed hat, and sharp metallic claws. Extracting... Shards of... Essence! From within the portals, as if he was building something. Only by entering a portal can you actually find out. Somehow, I don't think he would stop you.



	~NaGi - Eternal Stone - Green~

	~NaFi - Eternal Wind - Grey~

	~NaWi - Eternal Flame - Red~

	~NaZi - Eternal Ocean - Blue~

	~NaTe - Eternal Light - White~

	~NaDin - Eternal Shadow - Black~

"The Gateway"

	There are six Towers surrounding the city, you can't help but feel like they have something to do with the portals in the middle of town around the fountain. They seem dim, and dreary, as if they have been drained of all light. Dormant as they await the return of some lost portion of themselves. Tall and imposing in the distance, as viewed from the city, the cloaked figure always watching. What is this place, and why is he here? Is he the one who erased this once great civilization? Or were they long gone before he arrived?

	This is the world between worlds, when going through any portal, you will cross this plane at some point. This gives you the opportunity to visit familiar worlds, or Talk with familiar spirits, and gather supplies before proceeding to the next world. It also however leaves you vulnerable to other things lurking beneath the surface. Limbo debts unpaid, leave behind shadows of lost souls who are difficult to disperse, and may wander the gateway indefinitely. Beware the one who wears a cloak, as he will reap your nightmares like fine brandy. Savoring every moment of your despair. It is better to face your own shadow, than to face him alone.

	As long as you keep within the boundaries of the map, he will only observe you, least you devise a way to target him, or force him into motion. At which point, you will be absolved of your burdens, least you can fend him off, or escape his gaze. You may forge links between words within the Gateway, but beware, for you never know who might use them. It is a useful tool for navigating between many worlds quickly, but can also be a double edged sword, through which unfriendly spirits may also navigate. 

	Bring guards of sufficient power, and protect your encampments well, and you will have nothing to worry about... Right?

-----------------------------------------

"VoSti"

~Welcome to Rememberence~


1.	Prologue;
	"I started playing this "Game" before anyone else picked it up, the first survivor if you will. That's a bit hyperbolic, but I guess it's true, Started playing long before any of the astrology was implemented. Yeah, so that's how you know I've been involved with the Ideas that built it. I was there when it was written, played a hand you might say. Little did I know it become what it did."

2.	Governance;
	"It didn't start getting unusual before the astrology was added in, sure there were weird things like thumping at night, but when you live in a trailer it could be anything. Jokingly I decided to play along, making my own character in the game, my very own "Spirit." I figured because of the weird things that happened around my house I'd make it a Phantom, Ghost. Spitting in the face of my own signs, which placed me elsewhere on the chart. Joking, hell mocking, what I thought was going to be a fun little experience."

3.	Religion;
	"A couple weeks went by without incident, as I played the game off and on. Make a pact with some demons, sell some spirits to a ghoul for power, you know, Board game stuff. Things changed on the third week, the thumping wasn't just a knock here or there, but always three knocks right beneath my bed, in rapid succession. Scared me sober real quick, but I was in, it was too late. I knew he was there, and that he would only get stronger over time, I helped make this game, I knew the rules."

4.	Logic;
	"I had read about it, but I didn't want to believe it. Thoughtforms, Engrams, Memes, these things have some sort of metaphysical hold on us. Whether we believe them consciously or not is irrelevant, it's our feelings which give them power. The reaction they invoke when a beloved character dies, or when you laugh at something you know you shouldn't. Now there was Rememberence too."

5.	Wisdom;
	"I started linking with other players who had similar experiences, sharing our ghost stories. I don't think Jumanji was meant to be taken seriously when it was written, but the story takes on a whole new meaning now. Everything from transparent people walking through walls, to pets literally running up them. Children speaking to "Imaginary" friends, only to hear them repeating things that happened in game. To meeting people who match the "Spirits" personality wise 1-1."

6.	Wealth;
	"With the help of other players I found I was able to keep my spirit at bay. I was being punished by a bad joke, always having to keep him at my side consciously, least he run amok. Joining Parties, Groups of players in a single game, and using worlds created by others, helped a lot. I failed to realize what I was doing, long before it was too late. Still I played Rememberence, and the relationships I forged there are invaluable to me."

7.	Matter;
	"It started out as small acts of mischief, Raiding someone's fortress, Blowing up a farm, but things started escalating quickly. I built my spirit to be the CHEAPEST SOB in the game. Mimic, summon, vanish, a trifecta of the most unpleasant abilities to fight. it turned out that it worked, REALLY well, too well. I started by conquering some smaller worlds, taking them from players, rather than generating my own. Nobody could beat me, I would just wait, and force them to fight themselves indefinitely, until they finally ran out of strength."

8.	Illusion;
	"More, I needed more. It wasn't enough to tackle other players, hundreds of levels above me, I had to progress faster somehow. I devised the ultimate plan of attack, I would harness the world gods, and become the Master of Realms. That translated horribly to my personal life, as you could imagine, drunk 20 something, completely glued to his computer, playing a table top game online, it's ridiculous when you think about it. I kept playing though, and Every time I would take something over, the buzz I would get from that, nothing compares really. Knowing that I got to ruin someone's game, and obviously they could just kick me, and restart everything, but I was more sophisticated than that."

9.	War;
	"The game itself is designed with a fail safe for this very thing, Erase a spirit from the map, and all their contributions, then poof, map's clean. If they REFUSE to leave, and keep coming back, the map can be split into multiple timelines, but this wasn't enough to contain me. I worked my way into the map servers slowly, building cities, and contributing offspring to nearby player encampments. Playing nice by any discernable standard, always waiting to amass enough power and influence to finally make my move. Before finally sealing away the World Spirits, and stealing their power, setting my sights ultimately on the 6 Eternal Elementals."

10.	Space;
	"The more of a problem I became, the more the Mods took notice. It started with the earth elemental sending a Unit tier Icon after me. When I slaughtered it handily, they took a different approach. I was being ignored, and ostracized, rightly so Looking back on it now, but this infuriated me to no end. After all, I was the best player in the game, not even a ~MOD~ could beat me, or so I thought."

11.	Vision;
	"I wasn't even contemplating the scope of things, the gravitas didn't hit me until much later. I wasn't so much playing the game anymore, as the game was playing me, I really lost myself to it. Had I only used my own signs first, maybe all this could have been avoided. In some sense, it was always going to happen, if not me, then someone else would have tried to break this cursed game. Everything that happens around the people who play it, was preordained by the game itself anyway."

12.	Peace;
	"Before long I started noticing other things from the game overlaying reality. I developed an acute ability to notice and identify with another person's behavior. It was like my spirit was acting through me in many ways. If I was feeling uncomfortable, it was like suddenly everyone would start ignoring me, or I would take small trinkets from people just to see if I could get away with it, It was terrible. Being essentially barred from the main worlds took it's toll on me, the low population maps I could still get to, were essentially worthless for advancing my goals, so I started acting out those traits in reality."

13.	Decay;
	"I was drinking rather heavily, barely keeping my job. It was like the spirit had control of my whole life, when all I wanted was to take this game for a ride. It started turning into more and more complex server raids, where secret members of my faction would filter into a map gradually over weeks. Suddenly springing up in every city, triggering the mods, and forcing them into a scramble banning players wreaking havoc. Leaving the higher maps open for short periods of time, unprotected."

14.	Time;
	"It took months to actually expose the primary maps long enough to clone the elementals. Even in boughs of chaos the 6 elementals where who I was dealing with. The people controlling them have "divine" permissions, and can ban anyone they like. They made a mistake however, they thought it was only a game. The raids wore them down, and my perpetual assaults eventually eroded their will to keep stopping me."

15.	Signs;
	"That's when it grew beyond my control, I couldn't contain him anymore. The mods themselves eventually came to me privately. Telling me how the things I was doing were ruining their lives, being so involved with the front work of the game at the time. I had realized I was drinking too much, and when they sought me out, it flicked a switch in me. I had to start the game over, but much like life, it's just never that easy."

16.	Life;
	"I finally made a spirit for my own signs, despite being such a prick up to this point. Everything around me was falling apart, and I just wanted to do anything I could to make it better. It worked at first, the apology went over well with the mods, and some of the larger community, always inviting to everyone. My old faction, argued, and argued with me to play VoSti again. I insisted they disband, and that I was done with the manipulation, but they refused because they couldn't let HIM go."

17.	Blood;
	"My life had turned around, and things were going rather well until the raids started. I got blamed of course, and I had to explain VoSti had been taken over, and who ever had him now, it was beyond my control. There was nothing I could do to convince them, I was given a mandatory quest you could say, Clean up my own damn mess. I went through hundreds of versions of my spirit, building it back up from base, making it better, stronger. I knew I couldn't focus on my stats, There's WAY more to this game than that, I had to get creative."

18.	Spirit;
	"We threw everything We had at him, Legions of self spawning demons, Angelic Trolls, Massive constructs designed to destroy distant worlds. Somehow, "The Glitched" as they came to be known, were able to predict our every single move. Infiltration was a bust, because their maps were so well secured, We had to develop advanced weaponry, resorting to quantum targeting systems. We're talking some serious HooDoo here. We intended to erase the whole game, sealing VoSti with the 6 eternal elementals, and leaving this whole thing behind us forever.

19.	Minds;
	"Things never do go quite as planned do they? It was almost like I was being played the whole time. It's like he chose me that very first day, molded me into the sick bastard I became, and stole from me the redemption I so desperately craved. I gathered the 6 elementals for him, handed them over on a platter. I don't think anyone really expected what happened next."

20.	Owners;
	"We conducted our raid, distracting the Glitched, entered the temple where he stood, and found no user key, no log in information, no authentication, a literal ghost in the machine. I don't think it really hit me what happened until he spoke. He said to us that, uh... "Your worlds will be next," It's not like he was typing or anything, it was more like the game was speaking for itself. It freaked us all out so bad, we sealed him with the eternal elements, and started deleting EVERYTHING, but mid way through, all the servers went down at once."

21.	Lessons;
	"I made this monster of twisted desires, and thought I had rid myself of him, when we restarted the servers they were all empty. No games, no maps, nothing, wiped clean. My life was fine until I found out that Rememberence had taken on a life of it's own. Little bits of it being spun through out the internet, whether purposeful or not. I know now that I don't deserve redemption, or recognition. All I want is for a better person than I am, to come to Rememberence, and finally stop him."

22.	Truth;
	"I don't think I was ever really in a position to stop him, I was just the easiest path for him to travel. I took it for granted that it was just some game which couldn't effect me, but didn't realize, until I had already made far too many mistakes, that there are real people on the other side. That these spirits we create might have their own will as well, their own aspirations. No matter how hard I've tried, I could never really "Delete" my time playing Rememberence, nor the effects it's had on me."

23.	Mystic;
	"VoSti still draws on the gods, that seal will only contain him for so long. I've come to realize that even though I lost myself to him once, I found who I really was along the way. I can't participate in this battle, it's not for me to control him. He has changed over time, in ways even he himself wouldn't know. Now he's the common foe for all to test their might, a shared nemesis against which players can set themselves."

24.	Epilogue;
	"I never stopped playing Rememberence really, it gradually became a part of my everyday life. Seeing it reflected in the world around me, the beauty and wonder of it all, absolutely breathtaking. All we can do is avoid making the same mistakes twice. Leave our dead to rest, until such time when they are to be respectfully remembered. Please, do one thing for me, bring VoSti to his knees, because somehow, I know that only YOU can."

"NaGi"

~Consuming the World Tree~


1.	Prologue;
	"I always wanted to show the world how to make the ideal society. Something that was superior to the corrupt capitalist system of the United States. I admired Carl Marx, his vision for the future spoke to me intimately. How the working class could rise up against the snooty fucks in the 1%, and seize what was rightfully theirs. How they could retake the fruits of their labor."

2.	Governance;
	"It was just implemented wrong under Stalin, and Mao, the power corrupted them. A better person could have made something truly beautiful with the system they had put in place. It requires complete devotion to the party, and the message, for a classless society to function. Everyone must adhere to the doctrine on a deep personal level. They must be completely devoted to the cause, if only it was put into action in people's lives."

3.	Religion;
	"I first learned of the perfect socioeconomic system in high school. Where my teachers taught me that the redistribution of wealth through taxation was the only viable means through which wealth could be adequately circulated. I followed these doctrines right into my college days. Always sporting weird hair colors and styles... I'm sorry, I've grown a lot since then, I can't really put this down as if I'm still in that place anymore."

4.	Logic;
	"It was like bathing in my own hypocrisy for the sake of perpetuating an idea I had clung to like an addict. I noticed where it contradicted itself, and how it was internally inconsistent. Rememberence only made that realization worse. Picked it up with some buddies of mine. We did exactly what we were taught to do, we tried to implement a communist utopia."

5.	Wisdom;
	"We started running the dormitory like a gang of thugs. Anyone who so much as sneezed in the direction of an underprivileged person got "persuaded" of their wrong doing. It wasn't the game doing it, we were, we were just able to use Rememberence to make a false reality that isolated us from the world. We thought that because it was going so well with characters in the game, then surely everyone would want to follow our inherently superior ideology. We didn't really think we were doing the right thing, we talked openly about how terrible we felt about shaming people into silence."

6.	Wealth;
	"When the game started striking back against us, so did everyone around us. It was just a little village, we let them dissent, powerless we thought. Their numbers grew, and they over took one of our Utopian Cities. We couldn't believe it, decided to reset the game before the uprising, and just wipe them out. We were in for a shock the next morning, our hall was covered in feces and toilet paper."

7.	Matter;
	"When people started pranking us, and making fun of us, we lost our shit. We broke into people's rooms and thrashed them, we chased people with bats and chains. We were disgusting, disrespectful, tyrants. All the while acting under the guise of virtue. Despite our behavior, the school was terrified of taking action against us, so we continued."

8.	Illusion;
	"You might say we had privilege, or that we were oppressing our fellow students. Ironic now that I'm looking back on it. We became the very upper class tyrants we were taught to hate. When I tried to break away from the doctrine, just a little bit, it was like the shot heard around the world. I got kicked out of my room, and because everyone else already hated me, I was forced to rent an apartment off campus."

9.	War;
	"The ridicule came from all ends, students, teachers, the fucking janitor called me a "Commie Prick" and flipped me off. The only people who would talk to me was the D&D crowd, they were still sketchy. I introduced them to Rememberence, they introduced me to superior stories of epic battles. That's how I spent the last two years of my useless degree program. Hiding from the broader campus, and being a nerd in the library."

10.	Space;
	"I just consumed everything I came across, as they taught me how to weave a narrative, I began formulating a better communism. Too foolish to realize that I was falling into the same dumb ideology that had ruined my friendships before. Forged it into a faction I called The Crushers. An endless army of workers ready to disintegrate and assimilate everything in their path. We had the power to seize the means of production."

11.	Vision;
	"The creator of Rememberence came to me, asked me to play his Rock god NaGi, and let me know he encouraged my attempt to build an ideal Utopia in game. Even let me bring my D&D friends along with my faction. Before long we took the added power of the god, and new players and built many shining examples of distributed societies. Cyanide would attack us from time to time, but that's part of the game, we would go back and fourth. Thanks to the separation of, and autonomy within, the servers I was able to build my hypothetical paradise."

12.	Peace;
	"It was kind of strange really, the near infinite space within the game, and near infinite power of the god, made it exceptionally easy to formulate balanced societies. It's the innumerable supplies that were granted to me as a moderator. I could formulate anything I could imagine, and then some. It just wasn't satisfying my hunger. I had to consume the other factions within communist ideology, I mean, it seemed to be working so well for us at the time."

13.	Decay;
	"We went after the other factions for a while, attempting to convert them one moment, and just dominating them the second. It was partly in good fun, but we went pretty far into both Cyanide, and Templar territory. Most of the Legion were contractors, players who sell their services for cash, so securing their cooperation was simple as distributing some wealth. When the Glitched started invading everyone, our forces were distracted by various campaigns all over the place. We lost our capital city on the first raid, and I was infuriated."

14.	Time;
	"I sent a world tier clone of NaGi after their leader, couldn't stand the idea that the slimy fuck got one over on me. I realize now that communism can only work in a world of unlimited resources, but this thing, this monster and his faction, were something even more vicious. Not only did he stomp my lower tier clone, he added insult to injury by demolishing my main empire. He didn't even take anything, they just ripped everything to shards, and left it to dust. We had to find a way to bring them down, before they attained what ever it was they were looking for."

15.	Signs;
	"It took months of infiltration and planning for us to make our decision. We loved this game, and the worlds that had been created around it. We knew none the less that it would eventually be over. We fortified the hub world, and amassed our forces to force VoSti into the center. We didn't even think about what were doing, calling him like that."

16.	Life;
	"I spent time in an old cottage with my grand parents as a kid, my grandma would always make me warm cookies. The smell of tobacco always in the air thanks to grandpa puffing his pipe. Used to put on snow shoes and hike through the woods with him. We would set snares, and small game traps, only to let the animals go. My grandpa used to tell me, "You have to know how to fend for yourself, but if you live in abundance, it is better not to kill at all."

17.	Blood;
	"My worst experience was the first time I had to put something down. A squirrel had found it's way into one of our snares, which it managed to pull under a lower branch. It was horribly stretching the poor thing as it cried in pain, the wire slowly cutting into it's neck. I ran to it as fast as I could, tried to cut it loose with a knife my grand father had given me. The wire was too tight, and I slipped the vein right beneath it's jaw."

18.	Spirit;
	"That memory was running through my mind, the whole time we were fighting him. I was probably wrong, but I saw him as a caged animal, lashing out at his attackers. No player, no material body, just pure wild power, seeking to grow, and be set free. I felt sorry for him, and in holding back I may have set this whole thing into motion. He was that squirrel, he was in our snare, only this time, I actually wanted to slit his throat."

19.	Minds;
	"After we cast the seal, and everything went dark, I just left. I still play the game, but I just wanted to forget everything related to those experiences on the servers. Now that you're here, I know it didn't go according to plan, and I can't help but feel somewhat responsible. If he's back, then we've got worse problems than my past fixation on the doctrines of Marx. I would just fuck things up if I participated, but you have to get people together to fight him."

20.	Owners;
	"You should start where it all ended, The Gateway. If you build your spirits strong, and band together, maybe you can discover a way to defeat him, for real this time. As long as the gods remain, he hasn't won yet. If you can restore them to power, maybe you can bring balance back to the realms. Maybe you can lock him away forever."

21.	Lessons;
	"I never thought it would change me so much, that it would reveal my mistakes to me in a way I could digest. I thought we had put this all behind us, I haven't spoken to the other mods in years. Not since we shut down the server. I can't help but wonder how they're doing, but I don't think they would care what I think. Perhaps it's for the best that we leave this to the new generation of players, it's their time now, it's their story.

22.	Truth;
	"No, it's not my place to take part in this battle. NaGi still resonates with me slightly, the gods will aid you if you speak with them. Use their Rhythms, read the runes, and roll the dice, I'm sure they will know what to do. This is a new age, an age where it's possible to bring about unexpected futures. Truly a wonder to behold, even beyond the ideal utopian paradise."

23.	Mystic;
	"You have to find him, you have to defeat him. If you can't do it, then you have to find someone who can. VoSti is raw power focused with malevolent intent, if he consumes the gods, not even the creator could stand in his way. You can't let that happen under any circumstances. Or the consequences would be catastrophic to say the very least."

24.	Epilogue;
	"Let me leave you with a warning, this is more than you realize, and less than you presume I think it is. While it is only a game, it is a meta game, one that can both influence the future, and reshape our images of the past. If you have read this far, and you give up now, you will have wasted your time, and learned nothing. Only by making an effort to stop the destructive fore that is The Cloaked One will you truly come to Rememberence. Only by bringing others together, can you ever really bring him down."

	"I don't know man, this whole situation makes me uncomfortable. This game was like my life for the longest time, met most of my friends playing it. Something about how it plays just brings the right people together. It opened a whole universe of possibilities to me, and I'll never forget the adventures I had. You're not here to hear me romanticize the past though are you?"

2.	Governance;
	"I used to hang out with my friends, watching movies, toking up, ya know? Throw on some tunes and have some fun, we played cards against humanity, D&D, Magic the gathering... When we picked up Rememberence, it was like burning a hole through reality. A game that takes place in the future and the past, it just lined up with everything man. It turned our little group into a herd of space gladiators, good game that one."

3.	Religion;
	"When we started seeing our games play out, it was freaky as hell. We had one game, where a particular clerk was being a pain in the ass, when all we needed was directions. It's not that weird really, random chance and all, the game plays itself out. We were going on a trip not too long after that, and we wound up stranded at a gas station for 16 hours, all because the clerk insisted our money was counterfeit. In game, the clerk was in denial of our intentions, that's just one example too, I've got hundreds of these."

4.	Logic;
	"We had to start being more careful when we played because the games just got too real. We couldn't act like interstellar pirates, and do what ever we wanted. The things we did in game had parallels in reality, and we caught on to that pretty fast. We're fucking stoners man, I knew this was some mind bending bull shit. It's like the universe but condensed, and we handled that rather well, all things considered."

5.	Wisdom;
	"It wasn't all just peaches and cream though, we had some unusually close calls. We had done a raid of an adversarial village in one game, only to have riots in our neighboring town within a week. Did a dungeon run where the cave was flooded, and we're watching cars float down the street before we knew it. I don't think our games were making things happen, seems unlikely. More like the game somehow tuned into another point in time, to warn us of things that haven't happened yet."

6.	Wealth;
	"We didn't use it as well as we could have, it was still just a game we played on the weekends. Despite knowing what it could do, we still just played it like a game. We did do a couple games we thought would help people, played out a wedding for one of my friend's sisters. She's happily married to this day, and we barely lifted a finger, took all of an hour of gameplay. I guess we never really thought of it like some crazy power or anything, we just sort of went with it, let things play out how they did."

7.	Matter;
	"We always played as a team, it was us versus the cosmos. The wind in our sails, the stars on the horizon, but we started drifting apart. I was the star captain, and they were my crew, we had taken and freed countless worlds. When some of them just stopped showing up, I was sort of broken up. They were my friends, and they just left man, haven't heard from them in years."

8.	Illusion;
	"It was never quite the same after that, everyone started battling one another. Forged our own empires, we really went to town. It was month after month of endless warfare. When that started hitting in the real world, we had no idea how to respond. My cousin got SWAT called on him, One friend ended up in jail for several theft charges, the whole world just collapsed around us."

9.	War;
	"We opened up a little slice of hell right in our own back yards. When we stopped hanging out, I played the game alone for a while. I didn't think it would be, but for a written RPG, it's actually not bad solo. You want to play fair obviously, if the dice beat you, take the L. I did some dungeons and world raids, but without my crew, it was like a sail without a mast, aimlessly drifting."

10.	Space;
	"I went looking for some kind of rhyme or reason, it was like losing my whole world, and being left to darkness. It was strange, you wouldn't normally think a fictional entity, generated by a board game, could be a source of wisdom. Yet there she was, Elf, Holy, absolutely beautiful, When I interacted with her, and I know how this sounds, she told me "The path to wisdom you seek, lies in the heart of all creation." I played the dice, used my Bio's and the runes, it was like speaking through a math portal. Each roll of the dice bringing new insights, like pealing away all the layers of perception that had held my mind back as long as I can remember."

11.	Vision;
	"I started digging into the various creation myths around the world. Some creator god who forged the world from chaos, and passed that power to it's creations. Like the priestess told me, in the heart of ALL creation. I had to find what was common among them if I was going to find out why everything I knew fell apart. Why I was so helpless to do anything about it, even if I had tried."

12.	Peace;
	"I applied Rememberence, like a lens. It helped me pull apart these old stories, and really digest them in a new way. They weren't old dry tales of battles and discoveries, now they were playable scenarios in a living environment. I was so excited when I realized I could use Rememberence as a way to "Play" history. I spent weeks making Classical figures, and running them through their respective battles, and historical periods. You can't ruin your life, if everything you do in the game, happens in the past, Right?"

13.	Decay;
	"I started playing NaFi when the game's creator asked me to run a world for him. I'm not sure how he knew I played, but I had come to expect things like this. I was given outstanding power, a whole Omniverse. Not that I really wanted it, I was busy using Rememberence to play through the Victorian period at the time. It was like a side game, I used to sort of chill with the new peeps who joined my group, show them the ropes."

14.	Time;
	"I started playing on the servers more often, taking little groups of The Dazed on missions with me. We'd find some material rich world with only primitive tribes on it, just hang out a while as the natives worshiped us. Weird nonsense games like that, we'd go fishing or rabbit hunting, nothing that could have serious real world ramifications. It didn't last long until we started experiencing problems. I'd take someone on a mission, and they'd wipe out a whole tribe, destroy supplies, torch buildings, general random havoc."

15.	Signs;
	"It was never the same accounts, so we couldn't really prevent it, we'd just ban them and move on. It was like trying to keep bugs out of a garden, before long they were making it into almost every group of newbies. I started picking them out better as time went on, but I always missed a few. One mission was sabotaged by a freaky little demon asshole, who insisted he was trying to build the ultimate power armor. I should have known better, that little prick set off a chain of events that destroyed an entire space station, it took hours of material farming to build that thing, down the drain."

16.	Life;
	"You can kind of get hints as to a person's personality, by the kind of spirit they choose to make. You should never judge a book by it's cover, but this game has a way of getting into your head without you knowing it. Despite it beating you over the head with it at the same time. If someone makes an angel, they're usually looking for higher purpose. If they choose curse type, they might be feeling a lack of control, all you need to do is watch how they play, and you can read them just like a history book."

17.	Blood;
	"I was growing frustrated and bored with all the endless raids I was enduring, resetting things time and time again. It was happening almost every day, and I just got sick of it. Some newer faction called The Glitch, all they would do is raid other factions by posing as newbies, and corrupt people's worlds. Once someone has been on a map for a while, it's hard to untangle them from the timeline. You have to reset to before they ever showed up, and that often deleted hours upon hours of progress."

18.	Spirit;
	"Eventually several of the mods got together and tried to get rid of their leader, but somehow he had lost control of his own character. It had been stolen by his faction, who had admittedly gotten carried away. We tried to negotiate with them, said that they could join the main servers and play along with the rest of us, but they just sent us 10000 copies of a shit-sickle breeder with outrageous HP. We had to dispense with HIM if we ever wanted to be rid of them. All we had left was locking him away and shutting everything down."

19.	Minds;
	"It was carefully planned, we had spread the word through out the community. People knew why we had to do it, why we had to put an end to everything. We gathered everyone in the hub world, The Gateway, and we challenged VoSti in the middle of Mythos. We tore everything apart weakening him, every spirit there was wore thin or already dead, until only the mods and VoSti remained. We thought he was being controlled by an anonymous player, but there was no login, nobody pulling the strings, as if he had become his own Player."

20.	Owners;
	"Listen, I know how that sounds, but he was playing himself. At the final moment, we used our Chaos shards, and sealed him in the gateway, as we deleted the servers. It was like some black magic or something, everything in my house went dead at the same time, power, laptop, even my phone stopped working. Like the light just vanished, and the power was drained from everything. I woke up on the floor the next morning, not even sure how I passed out."

21.	Lessons;
	"If Rememberence is back, and he's come with it, we're all in serious trouble. He will stop at Nothing to assemble the Chaos shards, and breach the barrier between our world and the worlds of the spirits. If that happens, even the pits of hell will cry in agony, and no gods shall remain unscathed. I will have no part in this freak resurrection of long dead ghosts beyond this, You have to find others who will join you. Someone, somewhere can bring him down, but they have to be DAMN special to pull something like that off.

22.	Truth;
	"If he has the gods on their knees, and has brought back the memory of Rememberence, then he's closer than he's ever been to obtaining exactly what he needs to become the Master of Realms. Time is already out, but there might still be a chance for someone to prevent him from getting any further. With enough people able to destroy his various stages, over and over again, you may eventually weaken his presence. Hell you might even be able to destroy him entirely. We simply need enough people who have come to Rememberence with a drive to take his ass down!"
	
23.	Mystic;
	"I can only hope that the people who seek him do not fall prey to his corruption. Nobody should have that much power, especially not a freak accident of math and combined will. Someone will take him down, someone will free the gods. Just leave me out of it, I use Rememberence to unwind, and play through my history books while I get stoned on the couch man. I don't need to go down this path, even if it means letting that which strikes fear in fear itself seize unimaginable power."

24.	Epilogue;
	"Listen, if you want to stage a war against the fabric of chaos, go right ahead, I won't stop you. It's probably better that you do, because I don't even want to think of what he'll do if he escapes his digital prison. Just heed my warning, don't go into this looking for good vs evil, you get enough of that in real life. Take VoSti as a direct threat to the balance of cosmic order itself, a massive grinder ready to consume heaven and hell just the same. Good or bad, sooner or later, someone has to finish what was started all those years, maybe even centuries ago."

"NaWi"

~The Blaze of Desire~


1.	Prologue;
	"I wasn't expecting any visitors, but if you really want to know what happened to me. I can't just tell you, that would be too simple. I'm bound by the rules of these texts to give you a journey of self discovery. Can't have a game without a story right? That would be FAR too boring for someone like you, wouldn't it?"

2.	Governance;
	"It's already inside you, you know? Rememberence, and everything surrounding it, already woven into every, little, bit, of you. The sun rises as Avious song and harvest plants molt their leaves under the Holy light of the moon. Everything you've ever seen, every breath you take, and everything you've ever dreamed. Right at your fingertips, even if it's a slow ride."

3.	Religion;
	"Have you ever danced with the flame? Watching the embers burn as you twist in circles around the fire? Nothing compares, absolute freedom that, like the flame, dies far too quickly. Playing a game is like that too, dancing with the mechanics to get to the goal. A passionate thirst for victory driving your progress and improvement."

4.	Logic;
	"You've only just arrived, I still have much to reveal. Rest your weary head, and let me show you what is in store for you. Should you choose to proceed unwise of your situation, you will only face consecutive failures. Once our spirits touch you can never forget my embrace. Once we intertwine, you will never forget Inferno."

5.	Wisdom;
	"I began Rememberence when I was 19, I was working at a strip club, serving drinks. Do you have any IDEA what that's like for a young woman??? I was molested, harassed, and sure they got kicked out, but there would always be that one fucking asshole the next night. I found a game on the internet, that seemed like it might be interesting. I was in for more than I bargained for."

6.	Wealth;
	"I never really fit in with the other girls. Like we came from different worlds. I was only working there to pay for my books, and the room I was sharing with some quiet awkward chick. I eventually got her to play Rememberence, but it didn't last long. She decided it was too triggering for her, and had to put it down."

7.	Matter;
	"I was meeting online with other players long before I ever got involved with anything major. Just random little squads, doing their thing. I didn't even know some grand scheme was out there. Just waiting for us to discover. I played flames, and I played raids, that was Rememberence for me.

8.	Illusion;
	"I don't have any ghost stories, I don't have special powers. Unless, of course, you include my power over men. Rememberence opened the door that let me own that power. Helped me make it my own. The next time a guy grabbed my ass, NOT ALLOWED, club policy, I kicked him straight in the teeth."

9.	War;
	"He tried to swing on me, I let my back foot collapse, and dropped to the floor, remembering patterns from the game. The moment I was crotch level, I punched him with everything my already small, collapsed frame could manage, Corner Lateral. I must have hit him harder than I thought, because the front of his pants soaked with blood almost immediately as he collapsed to the floor with a squeak. I was fired on the spot and told to get out of there, I heard people saying he was going to die. I ran out of the back as fast as I could, never even bothered to see if he survived."

10.	Space;
	"It's not just that it gets into you, and moves you. It's that you like it, and if you use it properly, it's a valuable tool. In the wrong hands however, well, you would simply be dust by now. I run my own club, named my faction after it, "Club Inferno" All the best dancers, all the best drinks, all over the table."

11.	Vision;
	"It was Rememberence that helped me do that, the spirits come and go, but Infernos always blaze. We were dancers, and mobsters, The Inferno were like a family to me. We would build fortresses in strategic zones, and rent them out for protections. If they didn't pay up, we'd sink 'em."

12.	Peace;
	"The business was going well, raking in dough. Despite various factional conflicts, The Inferno were secure in our "Assets." I was invited to play NaWi by the creator of Rememberence, only after a year of playing. Said I could bring my faction with me, and we would represent the plane of Fire. I was way more ecstatic than I should have been, I didn't even reply for hours because I didn't know what to say."

13.	Decay;
	"With the power of a God I could play all manner of interesting tricks. We started building brothels in various worlds, strictly breeding grounds. I wanted a sample of all the other factions. We would produce children without the knowledge of the customer, and diffuse them for shards immediately. This was never a problem until the Glitch stole a few of my set ups."

14.	Time;
	"We had to scramble all our boys to the impact zones, it was a bloodbath. They had taken everything from the breeding sites, tech, essence, shards, everything. All that was left was a crumbled mess of useless debris. They were there and gone faster than we could organize. They knew where to hit us, and exactly what to take."

15.	Signs;
	"We started working with Crusher, and Legion more often, taking advantage of their capabilities. The Glitched were always ten steps ahead of us. In the process of rebuilding one location, and another location would be destroyed. As we'd be invaded, our own troops would turn against us. Nothing we did mattered in the end."

16.	Life;
	"Before I got my own place, I was on the streets. Never had any family to speak of. I went to a really dark place, selling my snatch for any swinging dick with $100. You will never really know what it's like, until you haven't eaten in days, and you're fucking some raunchy, fat, fuck, in the back of a pickup truck for dinner. Or getting plowed by an embarrassingly thin corporate type, with a dick so small you never even feel it."

17.	Blood;
	"I finally got out, but I never should have went there. Maybe I could have found a shelter or something better than, that. Had I not made that choice though, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Maybe you'd be reading the story of some other mod, for some other plane of fire. That's not how it turned out though is it?"

18.	Spirit;
	"I felt like I was on the streets again when the servers went down. Lost, empty, devoid of any meaningful purpose. It was my own spirit that kept me going, she burned like a torch in the shadows. We forged the club together, and things have been going well. Since you're here though, I don't think things went exactly as planned."

19.	Minds;
	"The night we called him to The Gateway, it was like watching the gods dance with their immortal and eternal foe. A dance of the elements clashing against a perpetual, and never ending mirror of smoke. We were frenzied in combat, as our ranks kept the plane of void still, though it quaked with every blow. By the end I didn't know if it was I who was playing NaWi, or if NaWi was simply using me to banish unrefined destructive power. At the moment we cast the seal, it was as if NaWi's warmth left my body.

20.	Owners;
	"Everything was dark for so long. All I did was sit there, leaning back in my chair. Moonlight peaking through the window. When the power came back up, I laid down, and fell asleep. I never talked about it again until now."

21.	Lessons;
	"We couldn't stop him then, and if he's come back, you won't stop him now. Take your own spirit, build your own stories. If you truly wish to face VoSti, don't take him lightly. It will take everything you got, and even then you couldn't hold a candle to that monster. You're better off making something for your own world, face your own demons.

22.	Truth;
	"For a moment there, I could almost feel NaWi, reaching to me. I don't think the gods intend for you to fight this battle alone. If you build your own armies, forge your own worlds, and face him down, there is a chance. I don't even know if restoring the gods would be enough, but it's the only thing I can think of. With their help, and enough players on their side, maybe, just maybe, you could take him down."

23.	Mystic;
	"Which ever you choose, your adventure has already begun. I hope that someone who is more wise than we once were, can put a stop to that thing. That monstrosity. Once he's had his fill of you, he just spits you out like a used rag. Reminds me of some men I know."

24.	Epilogue;
	"I thought it was all behind me, but now I see that it's only just begun. Don't try to reach me, I haven't given you enough to find my spirit. I'm sure the others were careful not to as well. We're had our time in Rememberence, now the next generation of players can take it beyond even our wildest dreams. Just, stop VoSti for me, ok?"

"NaZi"

~Into a Sea of Madness~


1.	Prologue;
	"I'm only allowed a few hours a day to talk to people, the Clinic doesn't let me to have many visitors. We're going to have to make this quick. Everything you want to know, those missing pieces in the stories, is hidden in the gameplay. I can't really explain it other than by saying, the game takes what could be, and makes it visible. That's why I'm still here, I'm safe here."

2.	Governance;
	"Once you start catching on to how we mix tales, and spin narratives through the board and the runes, you will start putting things together. It's a matrix of probabilities after all isn't it? In these halls, I can actually do some good with the things it taught me. I may be insane, but not everyone who comes here is, and they should be set free. I would never harm them, no, no, I'm not that kind of crazy. I'm the kind of crazy that seeps into your mind and can't get back out, the kind that torments your heart, and rips at your soul."

3.	Religion;
	"I'm still in Rememberence, though I'm not allowed to have a computer. It's in my head, my heart, I see the patterns scribbled into the tormented minds around me. I'm here to comfort them and pull them back to some version of a livable reality. I show them things, as Rememberence showed me things. Not like when I was out there, always so jealous, so spiteful, a different world indeed."

4.	Logic;
	"Was it the drugs as a teen, or the abuse as a child? I don't know for sure, combination of both? The path I've followed, the hand I've been dealt, came to exactly where it should have by now. A person who had cheated her way through high school, just because she didn't care enough to try. Got back handed in the garage by her father for smoking, I'm not surprised I'm in here."

5.	Wisdom;
	"It started as a means of escape, a way to stop reality and indulge in a fantasy world. Get spun out of my gore, just playing with numbers and scenarios. I tore down all my wall paper and drew a HUGE map, started using thumbtacks to mark cities and towns. That went over well. We have to get you though my back story, so that you can start your own journey, in due time."

6.	Wealth;
	"When you leave, I want you to find your own spirit, find yourself. Make something special that you can hold on to. A simple foundation on which to base your grand narrative will be invaluable to you. There's a man in here even I avoid, he's quite mad. His strength through Rememberence is incredible, despite his never having played."

7.	Matter;
	"I don't know why he's in here exactly, he doesn't talk. I do know the guards keep their distance, and every time I see him, the darkness that surrounds him, is down right fiendish. He would scoop food into his mouth with his bare hands like an ape. Almost as if by command there's some in here who will submit their whole meals to him at a glance. He doesn't mess with me though, despite being clearly out classed physically."

8.	Illusion;
	"He's afraid of the power I have. You know, I'm almost more powerful now, as a patient in this facility, than I ever was playing NaZi in Rememberence. Now I can use it as a tool to help people recover, while my beliefs themselves, coupled with my experiences, make me a permanent resident. I know everyone here, the patients, the guards, the doctors, all of them have been brought into Rememberence by me. I've made my own little world here, where I know how things will play out, every, single, time."

9.	War;
	"It doesn't work EVERY time though, just most of the time. When a new person comes in, I have to watch them a while to read their spirit. It's like seeing their story write itself right into the room around them. Weaving the tapestry of fate with every breath. Until they take your breath away."

10.	Space;
	"New kid, Cute, but as fierce as lava and fire crackers. Called him sparky, oooooh, he hated that. He only came after me once, Three of the other patients, who I had helped silence their nightmares, stood up and broke five of his ribs along with both of his arms. It was as fast as I had the thought that I should defend myself when he rushed me. I called him sparky in front of a particularly attractive intern, and he flipped his lid. He blames me to this day for manipulating those men telepathically, but nobody believes him, understandably."

11.	Vision;
	"I learned that we could share our thoughts and impulses with others long before I ever ended up in this place. The first time I remember making something strange happen was after I lost my virginity. It was at a party, and the guy I liked was coming onto me, I couldn't resist, only to see him kissing another girl not five minutes later. When the party was winding down, I kept thinking to myself that he should get into a car accident, even helped him find his keys. He only lived four houses down, how he ended up wrapped around a freeway support beam miles away is beyond me."

12.	Peace;
	"Once you realize how your thoughts and feelings seep into other people, you'll know why this game infests your soul. It's as if you had written the words yourself, which kind of makes you, me, if you think about it. In those moments, beyond the stresses of living under the constant pressure of society, where you really connect with someone, that's where the magic happens. It's only a matter of time before you do it to someone else, and they do it to you too. In that moment, you will uncover what is most true about reality."

13.	Decay;
	"I started doing coke in my teens, any kid with the right connections can get it, don't fool yourself. It sort of drove my time with NaZi and Cyanide. I was cynical, I just wanted to be a pirate, I WAS the water god after all. I couldn't stand the way the other mods built their factions, so imperial. The creator of Rememberence suggested I play an adversarial role in the game."

14.	Time;
	"I took that bait faster than you would think. I wanted to be a thorn in everyone's side. Destroying this or that. Drug induced tirades, breaking everything I couldn't have. Taking the rest and distributing it through my fleet of warships."

15.	Signs;
	"Not until one of my ships turned on me did I suspect anything was wrong. They raised a Pyramid on a black banner, against our aqua blue and bones. Those contemptable bastards. We eventually couldn't handle the loss of supplies and ships. We narrowly escaped complete erasure at the hands of The Glitched, as they turned ship after ship against our banner."

16.	Life;
	"Cyanide isn't afraid to fight dirty though, we started playing their game. Sending people over, attempting to integrate. Most of our spies were caught promptly, except for my elite team. They nearly got to him too, almost pinned him down, they had a chance. Or, I thought they did, I found out they died of mysterious injuries in their places of residence."

17.	Blood;
	"You can't expect me to dwell on this forever. I can't control what happens outside my direct influence, and not even then. When we took on the glitched, the only way we survived was to hide among them. The way they would steal the designs of others made that a bit less complicated if only you raise the right flag. But their tight nit groups made it difficult to get close to anyone in power."

18.	Spirit;
	"We were spying on them for months, and never encountered VoSti once. He was a ghost, almost like a myth told by his followers. Even high ranking members seemed to only have heard of him in passing. We never got anything useful, when we finally decided to shut everything down, it was a leap of faith. One that has clearly been in vain, perhaps it always was."

19.	Minds;
	"I had a battle with a cheeky orc fellow wearing a disgusting mimic cloak. It was always drooling all over the place, creeped me out to no end. He was bragging as if he had gotten the damn thing from VoSti himself. I couldn't help but beat the living shit out of him. We destroyed the whole place, and alerted the security network."

20.	Owners;
	"That's when I met him the first time, when they captured me and took me to him. Like a being of desolation made manifest in crooked shadows. Neither good nor evil, he cares not for such things, only his thirst for complete destruction exists. He destroyed the spirit I was using without a second thought, and left me with only two words, "Your mind" We confronted him shortly after that."

21.	Lessons;
	"I never wanted to end up helping him, it was a mistake. By getting so close to him, I had ruined our chances of defeating him. Now he knew we could get close to him, and now had what he needed to get to us. The mind has power you can't imagine, but you can feel, like an internal presence. If only I could have let go, and put everything I had into the seal."

22.	Truth;
	"I was gifted with the sight from a very young age, and Rememberence just made it more potent. I knew I held too much back when we closed the servers. I wanted to keep everything going, so what if we had to deal with some random jackasses? I was always against killing it, and I was so envious that the others could just let go so easily. I was given a window of time to discover a means by which we could topple The Glitched, but I failed because I never really wanted to succeed."

23.	Mystic;
	"The people here, they're like the glitched. Misshapen defects, cast into a place where society can keep them safely. That's why I came here, I left a hole in the veil where a terrible power could resurface, and I deserve to pay penance. I weakened the barrier by aiming to miss, and now he's back, and you have to stop him. You came to me to know, so he must already be back, and I'm not safe here anymore..."

24.	Epilogue;
	"I have to go, I'm out of time, you've been very kind to me, but really, I have to prepare myself for when he comes for me. It's only a matter of time until he finds me. Please, If you found me, he's already coming, I'm done here, nothing more to say. You have to leave. NOW!

"NaTe"

~Blinded By the Light~


1.	Prologue;
	"I'm the only player you need to talk to, this whole game, right here. I got you covered, when I started playing I was 17, father thought it was the devil's work. I showed him the light of god one night, brought him out of a dead sleep. He grabbed his gun, and rushed into the kitchen at the noise. I was digging in the fridge, and he shot me in the leg."

2.	Governance;
	"Moved out and picked up the game at the same time. I never met my mother, and after my father was sent to jail, I was on my own. Didn't want anything to do with him. Got a job at a comic shop, where I played Rememberence after my shifts with the night crew before they'd start. Naturally, they made me their de facto leader."

3.	Religion;
	"I rapidly forged a strict regimen for our troops, and built massive worlds. Convinced customers to join us once in a while. All around an exciting game, where anything could happen. My stories were always the best, well, the guy who took over my position at night was pretty good too. Just my skill with organization shot me ahead of my peers, in both the game, and my eventual promotion to manager."

4.	Logic;
	"They always envied me for that, I was just that good at what I do. The shop was running with profit, we had loads of returning customers, and new ones every day. The game progressed, and I named my faction The Templar. Sort of spitting in the face of my catholic father. Blaspheme, right to the core."

5.	Wisdom;
	"While people came to me for structure, I can't help but feel like certain people were pushed away. I kept pressing on none the less. Running both the shop, and the occasional nightly game. I didn't even know what I had, until I had long lost it. The day my father was released from prison."

6.	Wealth;
	"He came in to the shop, drunk as piss, got me fired, and wrecked the shop. I was so furious I wanted to beat the hell out of him. I didn't though, just called his ass a cab. I couldn't do that, despite what he did to me. I was better than him."

7.	Matter;
	"When I got home, he was waiting on my porch, beside the room I was renting at the time. He started yelling, but I just walked past him, told him to get his alcoholic ass inside before he got me kicked out of my place too. When we got inside, he only intensified, as if the walls amplified his voice. Yelling, Yelling, YELLING, I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed a plate off the counter and clocked him across the temple."

8.	Illusion;
	"I put him in my car, and drove him to the hospital, told them he fell down drunk. I moved out of the area after that. He spent a week in the hospital, I fractured his skull in six places, and they had to put a plate in. There was plenty of time to pack my important belongings, and ship out. I didn't want anything to do with him."

9.	War;
	"I wasn't even sure if he was still alive honestly. I took a trip cross country, taking in the sights. I wanted to explore the real world, much like I had once explored Rememberence. It wasn't like the game though, nobody followed my orders. Life on the road was a perpetual struggle."

10.	Space;
	"I finally stopped in a nice quiet little town, got a job at the local gas station. I kept Rememberence with me, and introduced people around town to it. Rebuilt my faction, which for a Christian town, they took to The Templar rather quickly. Even invited me to their church, tough I was forced to decline. More out of respect than anything."

11.	Vision;
	"Shortly after arriving in my new home, the creator of Rememberence invited me to play one of his gods, NaTe the Eternal Light. Brought my faction along with me, and we started building the plane of light. The community that started in the little town, built rather fast online, people took to their ideas rather easily. Before I knew it the Templar had become an imperial force, structured behind a divine being of blinding light. We were a force to behold."

12.	Peace;
	"As we grew we started competing with The Legion, and fending off Cyanide. We almost always came out on top. The only group who rivaled our power were the Crusher. A system of might and force much like my own. Our mutual contests forged strong bonds, and even deeper wounds."

13.	Decay;
	"I was in charge, It was my holy army, conquering the worlds beneath my wings. There were some little things that would happen here and there. Just incompetence on the part of lower ranked soldiers I figured. I didn't realize what was going on until I had seen what they did to NaGi. They thrashed his capital, left it in ruins."

14.	Time;
	"They were already deep inside my armies, turning my own soldiers against me. It was only a matter of time until my whole army was under the grasp of that cursed ghost, VoSti. We fought back as best we could, we withdrew into Crusher territory, circled the wagons. My forces were on the front lines, holding back the Glitched, our vigilance made us the Ideal defense team. No matter how hard we fought, they just kept coming."

15.	Signs;
	"The town couldn't take it anymore, they all renounced me. Left me alone in my house with my computer, a dwindling online following, and barely enough supplies to sustain my remaining troops. Those months we fought the Glitched were the longest months of my life. Isolated, running numbers, organizing troops, and attacking key locations. No matter how much he took from me, I would NEVER let VoSti beat me."

16.	Life;
	"We had retaken some Legion territory, and were planning our next attack when my father resurfaced again. Came out of nowhere, I can't even figure out how he tracked me down. I was out of the loop for weeks trying to get him to leave. He kept insisting that we were family, and had to stand by one another. I was losing time, and he was only a distraction from more important problems."

17.	Blood;
	"I got fed up with staying silent, I went back to the game, to hell with my father. My real family needed my help. When I arrived They were already failing badly, and ready to resort to their final attempt. They wanted to seal him away and shut down the whole game, forever. I didn't want to let them go just like that, and be left with my father, but we had no other options by this point."

18.	Spirit;
	"Every soldier, every battalion, the Glitched slayed or turned them all. I don't know if they were with us or against us from the very beginning. Our forces had been wore thin, and we were giving it our last ditch effort, to put him away. NaTe was in the center of Mythos with the other gods, as I kept a keen eye on the troops enforcing the plane's borders. This had to be executed flawlessly."

19.	Minds;
	"VoSti wouldn't just bow to power, it took a sharp wit and cunning. We had lured him to a single place by using the gods themselves as bait. Knowing we would be fighting to the final breath to wear him down before we sealed him away. We underestimated his powers, slinging his Glyphs as clones of us, and mixing our abilities flawlessly. How could a simple NPC be so incredibly powerful, and why can't we simply put an end to it?"

20.	Owners;
	"I was in shock, I had never seen anything really happen before that night. At the same time the servers were shut down, all the lights blew out. My father started screaming his shows were being interrupted because I didn't pay the bills. He suddenly stopped yelling, but when I got to him, he was frozen stiff, and staring in terror out into space. He never spoke again, just frozen in that twisted expression..."

21.	Lessons;
	"I still played Rememberence, I mean why not? Just never too publicly. I took care of my dad, and still work at the gas station. The town warmed back up to me after that, but refused to play Rememberence again. I even went to church every once in a while for holiday events. I will never know what he saw, and frankly, I don't give a damn.

22.	Truth;
	"I didn't expect to see anyone coming to hear that story. You don't have to tell me why, I already know. He's back, and you think maybe you can stop him. Don't sell yourself short, you probably can, eventually. If you think it will happen without training, and amassing new forces, you're dead wrong."

23.	Mystic;
	"He takes your strengths and turns them against you. He will turn the worst of you against yourself like a typhoon of self doubt, and loathing. Make no mistake, to fight him truly, you will have to awaken the deepest parts of your soul, and face them honorably. If you can't do that, VoSti has already won. Maybe he always has, maybe he always will."

24.	Epilogue;
	"The human soul is a fickle thing, bonding like cement in one moment, and slipping like sand through your fingers the next. Once you find yourself, never let that go. In the end of life, all that's left, is how you're remembered. Through this you know that some people have lived beyond their time. Both in the future, and the distant past."

"NaDin"

~Tempting the Underworlds~


1.	Prologue;
	"You have to listen to me, none of this is what you think it is. The way you perceive reality is foundational to reality itself. If that perception shifts too rapidly, or in the wrong direction, it could literally kill you. I don't think I can stop you from playing Rememberence. All I can tell you, is that this ISN'T just a game."

2.	Governance;
	"These symbols and archetypal patterns, they're built into the fabric of everything. It's not safe to take this kind of power and just hand it to any maniac with a rage boner. Human beings are cruel greedy creatures, who would just as easily throw you under the bus, as help an old lady cross the street if they thought it would give them some stupid social credit. We tried revealing their own power to them, and the corporations with endless money infiltrated and collapsed any chance we had. The information you have in your hands is Dangerous, and there are people who would do ANYTHING to keep it locked away."

3.	Religion;
	"As you build your spirit, weird things start to happen. It ties you into the fabric of everything, hearing people's thoughts, "seeing" the future, and once it starts, it never stops. I knew Rememberence was different, that it would effect me, It's mind hacking, I just never predicted how much. You've opened a Pandora's box of limitless power. Most terrifying of all, is that it has always been sleeping inside you."

4.	Logic;
	"How do you think the masses can be controlled so easily by media propaganda? It's because these systems of symbols and phrases have always been used to program people, and control their evolution. Why do you think people just vanish or die when they reveal corruption, when they point this shit out? You have come this far, so you probably already know that you can't simply "Speak Out" and reveal the truth, it must be done strategically. Maybe you think this is just some paranoid rambling, but trust me when I tell you, the truth is deeper than the pits of your soul."

5.	Wisdom;
	"We tried fighting back in Occupy Wall Street, but look where that got us. A whole lot more of the status quo, we only fueled their propaganda by standing against them. We were missing something they had, something we didn't realize was already there. Mass communication, spreading awareness, we were able to reach many millions of people, but so were they. We fought for years, until we found what was really being kept from us, Though we didn't know we found it until it was already too late."

6.	Wealth;
	"Have you tested these symbols on people yet, have you tried treating them as if you're talking to their spirit? You won't realize it at first, but when it starts happening, everything will just click. You will learn things about your friends you never wanted to know, but it will just happen anyway. I don't know if this will make you closer to them or not, but you will learn one thing for sure, even the most unreachable person is still only human. If you target the right people with the right messages, literally anything is possible, as long as you know who you're dealing with. That's why they don't want this information to get into the hands of the public, into your hands, they don't want you to have that power."

7.	Matter;
	"After you've tasted it, you never want to let it go. After you've molded relationships, and crushed your enemies, it's worse than drugs. You realize that you can make things happen, even if it's not quite the way you want it to. Rememberence was just an outlet for me at first, but everything that comes with it was more than I could handle. I was using the darkest secrets of everyone around me like knives to slice anyone who crossed me. Once I realized how much power, REAL power, the knowledge of others gave me, I felt like I was queen of the world, yet I was still constantly looking for more."

8.	Illusion;
	"I lived with my brother for the longest time, we used to play Rememberence together. At first it wasn't all that odd, some board game I found online, but before long it was playing out our lives right before our eyes. The way our father left in a violent drunken rage when we were kids, the way he died that night... We had built our game around things we knew, people, places, it was part of the game, with the birth days and all, no big deal right? We were wrong, we were very wrong."

9.	War;
	"Our father's spirit started causing problems first. After we resurrected it, it started behaving unusually. It was based off our dad, sure, but it was just some numbers on paper, we thought we were just getting spooked by playing the game so late. So we shut everything down in the basement, we lived in our childhood home, when our mother was institutionalized we couldn't bear to leave it empty or sell it. That night my brother and I had matching dreams, Passenger seat, father yelling at us through whiskey soaked breath, crashing, his twisted corpse sitting in our lap as the sirens arrived."

10.	Space;
	"We Rushed into the hall at the same time, and within seconds we knew we had shared the experience. My brother was frightened so badly by that he moved out of the country, probably the right decision looking back. I insisted that the game could show us the truth about anything we focused on, that we could use it as a tool, but he simply wouldn't hear me out. That's why I'm telling you, so that you can learn from my mistakes, and use this power for your own well being. While I failed miserably to do so myself..."

11.	Vision;
	"Even by speaking these words, I'm feeding it still. From the moment you read the first line, it's already influencing you, because the things built into it, have always influenced you. Maybe there was nothing I could do to stop things from going the way they did. Someone had to be the one who lost everything in their search for power, better me than someone else I suppose. Hell, it might have been predetermined by my own hand, long before I ever started reading in the first place."

12.	Peace;
	"I was playing the darkest path I could, all I wanted was the power to mold the world as I saw fit. I didn't know that would be more than I ever asked for, but when it started working, I couldn't stop. I started anonymously attacking Scientology online, it was a test, you know, just to see if the game could play out on a mass scale. Revealing their inner workings, crazy ass cult, starving people and locking them in dark rooms and shit. Before long, the number of spirits targeting the massive organization was in the hundreds of thousands."

13.	Decay;
	"You can't trust people, not even your family, the moment they know you're doing something differently, they will stab you in the back. I thought those who had gone the direction I sent them, had some unified presence, but the spirit I helped create became it's own kind of monster. I was surprised when it first grew beyond my control, they kicked me out, and it started acting on it's own, but the deed was done, they had become entangled in the fabric of reality, there was nothing I could do. I needed more power, the core of all power, the absolute truth, so my next project wouldn't get so far out of hand. I needed to know what only the Vatican, and the Deep State could know, I needed to control the ID, the Universal Unconscious Mind itself."

14.	Time;
	"Like all things in life, you have to get your hands dirty to get anything done. The simple idea of finding the source of mind, became an obsession. How could you possibly change the universal perception of everything, to include something you had created, which had not been there before? It's not a matter of rewriting the past, you don't have to take it that far, all you need, is to change the way people PERCEIVE the past, and then you inevitably control the future anyway. I thought the Illuminati were the only ones seeking this kind of power, until I found it myself, and realized THEY were my next target."

15.	Signs;
	"I sent my "friends" a few tips, hit message boards with information I couldn't possibly have, thanks to Rememberence, and a good sense of deductive reasoning. Major groups of 33rd degree masons getting targeted put the whole organization into a frenzy. I would be lying If I said I wasn't laughing a little as members of my old group were arrested, or simply vanished. Two birds with one stone, High ranking members were exposed, and I got my revenge for being ostracized, all in one fell swoop. I was a god among mortals, and all I wanted was MORE power."

16.	Life;
	"I failed to realize that everything I ever wanted, was everything I threw away in my search for power. The kind of power they have, wasn't what anyone really wants is it? People want a loving family and a tolerable job, nice little property, maybe a dog. When I tasted the power, it twisted me beyond recognition, without a powerful enemy, I started targeting pensions, and 401ks through deceptive language. Calling my targets, maybe even going to their house personally, dressed as an agent, or sales person, highly illegal stuff."

17.	Blood;
	"When the creator of Rememberence came to me, it was like seeing a ghost in the machine. I had been using it for all manner of horrible manipulations, I had ruined lives, which only made it worse when he asked me to play his god of darkness, and maintain a world. I had no idea how he found me, I never talked about Rememberence publicly, it was as if he had always known. I felt so guilty, here was the creator of the tool I had used to tear people apart, humbling himself and asking for my help. If anyone had the source of power I was looking for, it was him, and I would do anything to get it."

18.	Spirit;
	"I built a new Legion, He gave me nearly full autonomy, along with all the game materials, and help I could possibly need. I was able to live out my power fetish in a digital space, through the game. With other people to play against, and encourage along their own journeys, I thought everything was finally turning around. Until my demons started coming home to roost."

19.	Minds;
	"Some of my old "Friends" managed to find me, they joined the Legion, played the game better than I ever could. I brought them in, even made them F grade in the Legion, the highest value in hexadecimal. We were always battling the Templar, sort of a cruel Irony, how the game reflects reality. We would win some battles, and lose others, only to do battle once more. My Legion, it was MY LEGION, but it was all taken from me."

20.	Owners;
	"NaDin was the most powerful character I had ever played, essentially unlimited. Despite that, I lost control, and the Legion started acting out, making it's own decisions, like before. They would strike the wrong target, or intentionally disobey my orders, laughing at my inability to stop them. I tried everything I could think of, elite troops, demotion, banning their asses didn't even work. They just kept coming, one after the next, someone I thought was loyal, would turn coat with a twisted grin."

21.	Lessons;
	"I never really had control, you know, I was just a slave to power, it's servant. I did everything I could to ensure my own twisted desires were met, but never considered how that would affect others. When the only thing I ever really wanted was to be heard, and allowed to speak the truth as I saw it. I never anticipated how raw power would bore itself into my very core, how it would twist everything I was into something completely unrecognizable. How it made every dark intention come to life in the people around me."

22.	Truth;
	"Once you put something out there, it never really goes away. Even if you think you've buried the bodies deep, they have a funny way of coming back to haunt you. I lost my Legion, and gave up my power because it was the only way to find peace with myself. I follow my own spirit now, I have no need for excesses of power, the loss of the old servers was enough for me. We all had copies of the game, but we didn't need to publish anything about it, until now."

23.	Mystic;
	"I'm still living in the same old home, sort of a nostalgia thing, but I never did continue my path to power after that. We sealed him away, and erased everything, along with our own terrible pasts. Now we have to reach out into the world, Rememberence has resurfaced, and him along with it. If you're reading this, I can only hope, you will take up your arms, and fight him in my place. My thirst for power would only hold you back, because fighting him will take more than simple force of will, and common manipulations."

24.	Epilogue;
	"Now that you've listened to me, and heard my story, please, don't fall into the same traps I did. Don't let those greedy few at the top hide this information anymore, and don't hide it yourself like I did. Make the most of every moment, and make your spirits strong. Forge connections in real life, as you do so online as well. Build an army of people you can trust, and take this fight right to that cloaked bastard!"

Each Book of Guardians is composed of 24 Chapters, with 24 Verses each, which can be followed in any order, at random, or in any pattern.

5 Guardians per Chaos Shard.

NaGi;
Cogous, Vika, Ira, Leon, Davy.

NaFi;
Avian, Zohr, Ryu, Guy, Sonya.

NaWi;
Flara, Pluto, Sam, Jacob, Sally.

NaZi;
Midea, Jasmine, Erosia, Aiya, Kess.

NaTe;
Lazarous, Star, Cassedy, Tiff, Alice.

NaDin;
Noctra, Eldin, Daniel, Vier, Alabaster.

VoSti;
Fyo, Eliza.

(These connections are meant to be loose, and cursory to the characters themselves, having more to do with their respective universes, and which gods those universes are under)

Both True/Pure, and False/Corrupt play throughs are available depending on how the story is played out in each game.

The 4 Acts are as follows:

	Act 1 - "Shutdown"

	Act 2 - "Corruption"

	Act 3 - "Return"

	Act 4 - "Council"

1) The events leading up to, and surrounding the inital shutdown of the game servers. How characters from within the game experienced it, the trials and triumphs they endured along the way. Introducing the gods as a means of assisting the Guardians/Players in fighting the Glitched, moving along with the back story.

2) The events after Sealing away VoSti, and the gods vanishing, The advent of Corruption after the shutdown, while entities within the game struggle for survival. Seeking the old Mods through the chronicles. Leading to the player finding the original plot, and coming to Rememberence. "Those who seek the Chronicles, have come to find the way!"

3) The events surrounding the Main plot of the Game, as if experienced by characters within the game world. How the guardians themselves decided to work together and help players. Seeking powerful beings who can restore the Elder Gods, and defeat VoSti.

4) The events after, and concluding the defeat of VoSti. Formation of the Council, and how the guardians work together protecting the Chaos Shards after end game.

The first section will be primarily back story, leading into the Shutdown, and the corruption that followed. At the time of the shutdown, everyone "Died," and were forced to face their corruption, their shadow. Without the gods, or electricity for that matter, to maintain their worlds, things began to fall apart. Glitches taking over various worlds, while the remaining forces of the god's once powerful factions, fight along side other characters to fend them off. Leading eventually into the moment Rememberence resurfaced, and the player/reader discovered the game. Machines once used by the gods began to reactivate, their factions losing their minds, as the gods are tortured and diffused by VoSti. How the civilians, and the guardians fought for their lives during this time, now fighting not only the corruption, but also their old compatriots. The guardians during this time seek players to help them restore the gods, and again bring peace to the realms. Forming The Council of Guardians, to both protect players, and the Chaos Shards.

It is possible to do a Corrupt Play through, by helping your selected Guardian's shadow win instead of helping them fight it off. The Pure play through is always being attacked by Corrupt versions of the characters in that area, and the Corrupt play through is always being attaked by purified versions of the characters in the area. This allows the player to more easily join VoSti, corrupting the main storyline, and helps flesh out a pure playthrough, bringing near limitless variety to the story with the Guardians having both corrupt and pure versions at any given time. Running both pure and corrupt stories at any given time.

The player is free to mix and match Guardians in any order they choose, and follow their stories if they choose, in any order they choose, on any path they choose. The Guardians may be a little frisky at first, but if you earn their trust, they may be invaluable to you. Each Guardian has a unique personality, so you'll have to try different things. They may be found in the Gateway at random, You can meet them there if you've never interacted with them before, you can call them there after you have. It's the world between worlds, and they travel through there often. You may also encounter their shadows there, as the Gateway is where shadows are born. You may even encounter them battling their shadow, in that instance they will be at full power, both themselves and the shadow. Not a good time to strike up a conversation. Worse still, they may both have armies at their side. For each Guardian Faction, there is a Corrupt inversion, beware large scale battles, or join them, your call.

The ability to mix their stories together, as allies or enemies, pure or corrupt, allows near infinate imersion for each and every playthough. The player drives the story, able to bring both paradice and armageddon. You may remain in any portion of the timeline as long as you like, moving both forward and backward, when ever you choose, to any point you've already experienced.

---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

This project is going to be a LOT of writing. Following the 32x24x24 formula isn't going to be hard, and hashing out the plot points here will work well as a mental map. 

Each Guardian protects a speciffic set of Universes, aligned with a particular Chaos Shard and Diety. Except for VoSti, and his shard, which are protected by a king and queen chosen by the blessing of the Elder Gods.

The Realms of the gods become hub worlds for the Guardians who follow them, to protect their shards.

---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

Verses in the Chronicles should be written as teasers for the larger Chapters they represent. The Chapters themselves laying out in detail the events of that Verse within the Chronicle.
