Alright, before we dive in, a brief intro section:

Classes, Skills, and Styles

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Melee; Basic physical attack, must be next to the target. 

2) Ranged; Basic distant attack, does not have to be next to the target.

3) Magic; Basic elemental abilities, does not require being next to the target.

4) Step; Basic enhanced movement, changes the way a spirit moves when activated.

5) Special; Basic color abilities, May effect various gameplay functions.

6) Trance; Transformations, drain MP each turn depending on the trance, enhances the natural abilities of a spirit.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Skills use the Primary Leveling System For Mastery tier progress, but they do not receive Sp. Instead, all Skill bonuses are multiplied by Mastery tier level. 

You may not craft/enhance items or skills above the Spirit's mastery tier, and they may not use items or skills above their mastery. Only items and skills at, or below their mastery, may be equipped and utilized.

It takes 1k of the appropriate skill shards to learn a new skill, it may then be leveled up normally. Equipping an item in your skill slot for a particular class overrides the base skill bonuses, but does not prevent you from using them separately.

Skill bonuses on ATK/DEF/SPD may be added to the ATK/DEF/SPD of the material/materia equipped in that skill slot when using the base skill instead of the equipped material/materia.

Any custom items/abilities you create to fill your skill slots follow this same tier system, and may be leveled up similarly to the base skills themselves. You may not equip items to your skill slots which exceed your skill mastery.

	"As swords meet shields, and armies clash. The force of mighty blows rings over the battlefield like war drums pounding to the rythm of silent nights.
