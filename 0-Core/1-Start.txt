-----------------------------------------
Your First Spirit:

	Fill out a blank character sheet from Icons/Custom, with the selections you just made.

	Every Spirit has a name, though not all may be willing to share. Choose your Spirit's name, and give them a short description, use your imagination.

	Your combat stats are determined by your Species added to your Biorhythms as set by your Type. Each type uses different Biorhythms to increase HP, ATK, DEF, SPD, and MP.

	Your Zodiac choices determine your Biorhythms by adding stats from each sign together.

	Your Spirit's Thoughts are determined by comparing Biorhythms in the Structure file and calculating their end state. This is used to discover their personality, and how they interact with other entities. Including you.

	Your Class Skills determine what kinds of weapons and abilities your spirit can use, and gives them all manner of different benefits depending on the skill.

	Any items, objects, or essences, you discover or create in your journeys should be placed below this point.

Good Luck...
